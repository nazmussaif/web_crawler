The actor has worked in more than 150 films in his career, and is considered as one of the most dominant actors of his time. Most of his works were critically acclaimed and commercially successful.
Farooque was involved in student politics, and participated in the six-point movement in 1966. He was inspired by the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and participated in the Liberation War of Bangladesh as well.
Born and brought up in old Dhaka, Farooque's hometown is in Gazipur, Kaliganj. In his youth, he used to attend stage shows that took place in his area, along with his friends.. ""Coincidently, I didn't realise when did I fell in love with acting!"" shares Farooque.
His journey in films began with Jolchhobi  in 1971. Khan Ataur Rahman's Abar Tora Manush Ho (1973) took him to superstardom. Later, he was featured in iconic movies like Lathial (1975), Sujon Sokhi (1975), Amzad Hossain's Golapi Ekhon Train e (1978), Abdullah Al Mamun's Sareng Bou (1978), and Chashi Nazrul Islam's Mia Bhai (1987), among others.
Farooque never celebrates his birthday, as it is on the same month as the national mourning day. ""After 1975, I never felt like celebrating this day,"" he affirms. ""Life is like a river, it keeps flowing as long as it has life. What matters most is what we do for our society."" Although he is away from the silverscreens for many years now, he is fulfilling his duty towards the people. He wishes to serve the country as long as he can."

The number ends in five eights, a sought-after combination in China as the word ""eight"" in Mandarin sounds similar to the word for ""prosperity"".
The number was among assets seized and ordered auctioned by a court in Beijing, and an online sale attracted more than five thousand bids between Saturday and Sunday.
Phone users in China -- especially companies seeking to impress clients and business partners -- often pay a premium for combinations of digits considered lucky.
Eight is the most sought after digit, and so prized in China that the opening ceremony of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing started officially at eight minutes past eight on the eighth day of August, the eighth month.
The number four, which in Mandarin sounds similar to ""death"", is least favoured.

","The dwarf planet Ceres -- long believed to be a barren space rock -- is an ocean world with reservoirs of sea water beneath its surface, according to new research.
Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and has its own gravity, enabling the Nasa Dawn spacecraft to capture high-resolution images of its surface.
Now a team of scientists from the United States and Europe have analysed images relayed from the orbiter, captured around 35 kilometres (22 miles) from the asteroid.
They focused on the 20-million-year-old Occator crater and determined that there is an ""extensive reservoir"" of brine beneath its surface.
Several studies published Monday in the journals Nature Astronomy, Nature Geoscience and Nature Communications also shed further light on the dwarf planet, which was discovered by Italian polymath Giuseppe Piazzi in 1801.
Using infrared imaging, one team discovered the presence of the compound hydrohalite -- a material common in sea ice but which until now had never been observed from Earth.
Maria Cristina De Sanctis, from Rome's Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica said hydrohalite was a clear sign Ceres' used to have sea water.
""We can now say that Ceres is a sort of ocean world, as are some of Saturn's and Jupiter's moons,"" she told AFP.
The team said the salt deposits looked like they had built up within the last two million years -- the blink of an eye in space time.
This suggests that the brine may still be ascending from the planet's interior, something De Sanctis said could have profound implications in future studies.
""The material found on Ceres is extremely important in terms of astrobiology,"" she said.
""We know that these minerals are all essential for the emergence of life.""
Writing in an accompanying comment article, Julie Castillo-Rogez, from the California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said the discovery of hydrohalite was a ""smoking gun"" for ongoing water activity.
""That material is unstable on Ceres' surface, and hence must have been emplaced very recently,"" she said.
In a separate paper, US-based researchers analysed images of the Occator crater and found that its mounds and hills may have formed when water ejected by the impact of a meteor froze on the surface.
The authors said their findings showed that such water freezing processes ""extend beyond Earth and Mars, and have been active on Ceres in the geologically recent past""."

","The government has directed ministries and divisions to pick high-priority projects from the list of the unapproved schemes in the annual development programme as development work has been hamstrung by revenue shortage caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
The country would require Tk 924,203 crore to implement all of the 1,626 ongoing development projects. The government has, however, allocated Tk 204,144 crore for ADP this fiscal year.
""At the current pace of allocation, it would take more than five years to implement the projects,"" said the planning ministry in a report.
The government has allocated Tk 495,097 crore as of June for the ongoing development projects included in the ADP.
There is a huge difference between the need for financing and the fiscal space, the report said.
The report was presented at a meeting of the secretaries on 10 August.
Planning Minister MA Mannan convened the meeting to prepare a roadmap to ensure full implementation of the ADP this fiscal year after development expenditure fell to a 27-year low last fiscal year.
The ministry said a limited number of projects should be undertaken for the sake of planning and fiscal discipline while adopting a project.
There are 1,347 projects in the current ADP that have not secured any allocation yet.
Most of the times, projects are undertaken without a proper feasibility study and technical design, ignoring instructions from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) to do so. As a result, the schemes go through revisions for a number of times during the implementation period.
Sometimes, projects are taken up because of the pressure from influential groups or politicians and only a small amount is allocated for them every year, said an official of the planning ministry.
""It would not be appropriate to prepare a project for approval if it is undertaken without a feasibility study and technical design,"" the report said.
A feasibility study may be carried out before a ministry or division initiates an investment project. The ministry or division may approve a feasibility study involving up to Tk 5 crore.
Sometimes, the project is scaled down and then it gets approval.  Later, initiatives have to be taken to revise it when its scope expands during the execution phase.
As a result, ongoing projects are not complete as per the schedule and the progress of the work is interrupted, depriving the people of benefiting from them.
If the cost of projects goes up, it would be logical to implement the approved projects within the deadlines before undertaking any new ones, the report said.
The planning ministry has written to all ministries and divisions, instructing them to take steps to classify the projects as high, medium and low priority.
The ministries and divisions may only assess the high priority projects by taking into consideration the required assets or liabilities of the ongoing projects and the projection on the mid-term budgetary framework.
The ADP has targeted to finish off 381 projects in the fiscal 2020-21.
An inter-ministerial meeting can be called in November or December to ensure adequate or increased financing to complete the projects, the planning ministry report said. 
Some 317 projects were up for completion in the last fiscal year. Of them, 137 projects could not be finished because of the coronavirus pandemic.
As per a decision of the NEC, the deadline of the unfinished projects has been expanded by a year under special consideration and they have been included in the ADP for the current fiscal year and were allocated funds.
The planning ministry has directed the ministry and divisions to take measures to ensure adequate funds for the projects.
According to the planning ministry, foreign aid use is important for the overall progress of the ADP.
But foreign aid allocation has gone down in the revised ADPs in the last few years as ministries and divisions could not use them properly.
The government allocated Tk 73,078 crore from foreign aid in favour of 376 projects this fiscal year. 
The planning ministry advised the ministries and divisions to beef up the monitoring to execute aid-backed projects in fiscal 2019-20.
If the secretaries or senior officials of ministries or divisions pay regular field visit, it would play an important role in ensuring proper implementation and quality of projects, the report said, adding that the heads of implementing agencies and project directors should intensify regular inspection and monitoring.
The recommendations made by the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division in its report should be followed properly, the report said.
Development activities came to a screeching halt after the government was forced to implement a countrywide shutdown from 26 March to rein in the rising COVID-19 caseload in Bangladesh.
The ministries and divisions managed to spend Tk 161,857 crore in fiscal 2019-20, which was 80.5 per cent of the total allocation for the year.
The development budget for this fiscal year is Tk 205,145 crore, which is 6.3 per cent higher than last year's.
The government's fiscal space has squeezed as the coronavirus-induced countrywide shutdown has paralysed the economy. Revenue collection in the just-concluded fiscal year dropped 2.3 per cent."
www.thedailystar.net/business/news/banks-dive-treasury-bills-bonds-interest-income-falls-1946837,Business,2020-08-18T00:00:00+06:00,2020-08-18T00:00:00+06:00,"Banks dive into Treasury bills, bonds as interest income falls","Listed banks increased their investment in government and corporate bonds, securities and stocks in the second quarter of 2020 to offset the loss in interest income caused by the ceiling on lending rates.

","Listed banks increased their investment in government and corporate bonds, securities and stocks in the second quarter of 2020 to offset the loss in interest income caused by the ceiling on lending rates.
Their investment in bonds and other securities rose 8.84 per cent to Tk 314,747 crore as on 30 June. Investment income surged Tk 842 core, or 49 per cent, to Tk 2,546 crore in the quarter.
The data was calculated based on the half-yearly financial statements of 25 out of 30 banks listed on the Dhaka Stock Exchange. The reports of Al-Arafah, Brac, ICB Islamic, Standard and United Commercial Bank are not available on their websites.
""As the interest rate of Treasury bills and bonds was high and banks did not need to keep provisions against the investment, it was better to invest into these instruments,"" said Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank.
The government capped the lending rate at 9 per cent and the deposit rate at 6 per cent on 1 April. As banks have had to comply, the net interest income of the lenders plunged 39 per cent to Tk 3,095 crore in the second quarter.
The spread, the difference between the lending rate and the deposit rate, fell to 2.5 per cent to 2.75 per cent in the April-June quarter due to the single-digit lending rate.
""So, the interest income was expected to receive a major blow,"" Rahman said.
Although the lending rate went down to 9 per cent, many of the banks could not bring down the deposit rate to 6 per cent. One bank is still offering deposits at 7.5 per cent, according to Rahman.
As Bangladesh's trade with the rest of the world plummeted during the quarter because of the coronavirus pandemic, banks' earnings from commissions and charges also fell.
The commission and charge income dropped 24 per cent year-on-year to Tk 1,110 crore. The profits declined 35 per cent to Tk 1,263.97 crore in the second quarter due to the lower interest income and commission on their services.
Bangladesh's export earnings plunged 16.93 per cent to $33.67 billion in the just-concluded fiscal year, the lowest in five years, as the pandemic brought global trade to its knees.
""Some banks will try to increase their investment in Treasury bills and bonds to make profits but they will have to expand their loan books because the interest rate on government bills and bonds has already been cut,"" Rahman said.
The interest rate on Treasury bills and bonds came down to 8.1 per cent from 9 per cent.
The current half of the year would be more challenging as the two quarters will suffer from the problem of the lower interest income, Rahman said, adding that banks saw a higher interest income in the first quarter.
""Moreover, the country has been affected by floods and we still don't know when the pandemic will pass.""
The banking sector's future will also hinge on the orders the garment sector would receive in the spring.
A top official of another bank, which has increased investment in bonds and securities significantly, said as the outbreak of coronavirus was getting out of control during the second quarter, there were no other options but to raise investment in bonds, securities and some other safe instruments.
""Most of the banks did this.""
Of the 25, 19 banks bought more bonds and securities, but this did not spare them from losses.
""We failed to halt the profit fall during the period. Profits of a bank can't be ensured from these investments alone,"" the banker said.
The stock market was not the beneficiary during the period either.
DSEX, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, dropped 0.47 per cent to 3,989 on 30 June compared with 25 March.
""The stock market was riskier, so we were not interested in investing in the speculative market. But now we are putting some money into the market,"" the banker said."

","Russia said yesterday the first batch of the world's first Covid-19 vaccine would be rolled out within two weeks and rejected as ""groundless"" safety concerns aired by some experts over Moscow's rapid approval of the drug.
The vaccine, called ""Sputnik V"" in homage to the world's first satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957, has yet to complete its final trials and some scientists said they feared Moscow may be putting national prestige before safety.
""It seems our foreign colleagues are sensing the specific competitive advantages of the Russian drug and are trying to express opinions that in our opinion are completely groundless,"" Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said the day after President Vladimir Putin announced it had won regulatory approval.
On the streets of Moscow, some Russians said they would be too scared to try the vaccine, while others agreed with their government that scepticism expressed by foreign experts was driven by jealousy.
""I don't trust Russian vaccines in general, I definitely won't get vaccinated,"" said Ekaterina Sabadash, 36, speaking outside Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre.
Alexander, a photographer, was also wary. ""Until it goes through (final) clinical trials and we get some confirmed results, I would be scared to get it done,"" he said.
Others said they understood why Russia was in a hurry to get a new vaccine and trusted it, but doubted they would really have a say in whether to have it.
""I'm a teacher and they'll recommend we get it,"" said Irina Fashchevskaya, a Moscow resident. ""We'll be forced to do it.""
Officials have said that the vaccine, developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute, would be administered to people, including doctors, on a voluntary basis in the final trial. Mass roll-out in Russia is expected to start in October.
Scientists from Germany the United States and Britain have queried the wisdom of approving the vaccine before testing is complete, saying it was risky from a safety point of view.
Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's RDIF sovereign wealth fund, has spoken of an information war against his country, an assertion that finds sympathy with Russians weary of what they regard as years of Western condescension.
Mikhail Mechyov, a 42-year-old Moscow resident, said he saw jealousy behind Western warnings.
""It's natural to be cautious, but they are aimed at belittling the achievement of our country,"" he said. ""I think a lot has been done and it's great there is a vaccine.""

The Moscow-based Association of Clinical Trials Organizations (ACTO), a trade body representing the world's top drugmakers in Russia, had urged the health ministry to postpone the vaccine's approval until the final trial had been completed.
""It's the ambition, the desire to be first in a field in which, unfortunately, Russia cannot vie for a top spot,"" executive director Svetlana Zavidova told Reuters.
""Our task is now to warn the population because we so far don't understand how they (the authorities) are going to carry out mass vaccination.""
Final trials, normally carried out on thousands of participants, are considered essential in determining safety and efficacy. Only about 10% of clinical trials are successful.
The Philippines and Kazakhstan have expressed interest in the vaccine, while a senior World Health Organization says it has not received enough information to evaluate it.
Roman, a taxi driver in the Vladimir region, invoked a conspiracy theory to explain why he would be avoiding it.
""It's all about a global plan to put microchips into people being pushed by Bill Gates. I have zero trust,"" he said.
Heidi Larson, who leads the Vaccine Confidence Project (VCP), a global surveillance programme on vaccine trust, said she feared Russia's rush could further dent public trust.
A survey in 19 countries, carried out by VCP and Business Partners to CONVINCE, a U.S./UK initiative that is partly government funded, is set to show that Russians were the least trusting of vaccines.
Putin, who said the vaccine had already been administered to one of his daughters without any problems, and a string of other officials have insisted it is safe."

He [Sinha] also got down. I heard him saying, 'Calm down, calm down'… Moments later, I heard the gunshots… I saw Sinha lying on the ground,"" Shahadul Islam Sefat, who was accompanying Sinha, has said.","Right after Maj (retd) Sinha and Sefat revealed their identities, Inspector Liaqat ran in front of their car and put a drum in front of it.
""Stepping out of the car, I started walking towards the rear. He [Sinha] also got down. I heard him saying, 'Calm down, calm down'… Moments later, I heard the gunshots… I saw Sinha lying on the ground,"" Shahadul Islam Sefat, who was accompanying Sinha, told law enforcers after he was arrested on the night of July 31. The video of that conversation was broadcast on a private television channel today.
In another development, a Cox's Bazar court today placed seven people, including four policemen, each on a seven-day remand in a case filed over the killing of Major (retd) Sinha Md Rashed Khan.
Sefat, who was accused in two cases -- murder and narcotics -- filed by police following the killing, was released on bail on Monday.
""We had the camera tripod but no one could recognise it as a tripod at the time. We had no firearms while we got down from the hill.""
""When we arrived at the check-post, the on-duty police officials told us, 'Ok you may go'…. Then he [Liaqat] came towards us when we started pulling up the windows [of the car] and he said, 'Wait, Say it again [our identities].'
""When we revealed our identities, he placed a drum on the road before our car...""
Moments later he heard gunshots and saw Sinha lying on the ground.
""I thought the bullet had not hit him… it was just a blank fire. …. Then I noticed Sinha in a pool of blood,"" Sefat said. ""When Sinha got down from the car, I saw that he left his pistol [inside the car] and came out from the car with hands over his head… I was at the back of the car and I could not see his steps.""
Rab had sought a 10-day remand to interrogate constables Safanur Karim, Kamal Hossain and Abdullah Al Mamum, and Assistant Sub-inspector Liton Mia, who are accused in a case filed by Sinha's sister Sharmen Shahria Ferdush.
The four policemen are among seven suspended members of the force who surrendered to a court on August 6.
The court earlier granted permission to the investigation officer (IO) to interrogate Safanur, Kamal, Mamun and Liton at the jail gate.
The IO of the case Rab Assistant Superintendent of Police Jamil Ul Haque on Tuesday also sought a 10-day remand for Nurul Amin, Nizam Uddin and Md Ayash following their arrest by Rab from Marishbania in Cox's Bazar.
The three were named as witnesses in the murder case filed by the police following the shooting.
Teknaf Senior Judicial Magistrate Tamanna Farah passed the 7-day remand orders after hearing separate remand petitions, our Cox's Bazar correspondent reports, quoting lawyer Mohammad Mostofa.
""We will take the seven accused in our custody tomorrow [Thursday] to interrogate them,"" said Lt Col Ashik Billah, director of Rab's legal and media wing.
Officers will start quizzing three other accused -- ex-officer-in-charge of Teknaf Police Station Pradeep Kumar Das, Inspector Liaqat Ali, and Sub-Inspector Nandadulal Rakhshit -- later he added.
The court on August 6 placed Pradeep, Liaqat Ali, and Nandadulal Rakhshit on remand for seven days. Inspector Liaqat Ali, who shot Sinha, is the prime accused in the case filed by the major's sister.
Sinha, 36, used to make travel videos for a YouTube channel called ""Just Go"". On the night of July 31, he was returning to Cox's Bazar from Teknaf.
His car was stopped at Shaplapur on Marine Drive by police.
Police claimed that they were about to search the vehicle when Sinha aimed his pistol at them, prompting them to shoot back in self-defence.
They also claimed that they seized drugs from the vehicle.
However, witnesses have been giving a different account of the incident. They said Sinha got down from his car, put his hands over his head, and then police shot him."

She was 83.
The photographer who had been suffering from old age complications breathed her last at her residence in Banani around 3am.
Born in Pabna on December 29, 1937, Sayeeda Khanam  completed her masters in Bengali literature and Library Science from the University of Dhaka.
In 1956, she started her career as a photographer in Begum, the only newspaper dedicated to women at that time.
She covered many national and international events. She worked as a photographer with renowned filmmaker Satyajit Ray in three of his films.
Khanam worked as a librarian in Bengali Literature department of University of Dhaka from 1974 to 1986.
After the war, she volunteered as a nurse in Holy Family Hospital for a while.
Khanam had her first international exhibition in 1956 after participating in the International Photo and Cinema Exhibition, Cologne.
In the same year, her works were displayed in an international photography exhibition held in Dhaka and later exhibited in international competitions in Japan, France, Sweden and Cyprus.
Her works on Mother Teresa, Rabindra Sangeet singer Konika Bandopadhyay and Satyajit Ray were also exhibited in Dhaka.
In 1960, she received an award in All Pakistan Photo Contest and in 1985 she was honoured with UNESCO Award for photography.
She received many other awards from several national and international organisations and was a lifetime member of Bangladesh Mahila Samity and Bangla Academy.
K M Khalid MP, state minister for Cultural affairs, expressed deep shock and sorrow at the death of Sayeeda Khanam."

The object looks like a square-headed monster on a tripod.

The object looks like a square-headed monster on a tripod. Who would have imagined then that the little girl would one day capture the world with this very object? ""I never thought that this camera will one day become my life partner,"" chuckles Sayeeda Khanam, Bangladesh's first woman photojournalist.
Sitting in the sparsely decorated living room that still carries the aura of the past, the 75-year-old veteran photographer tells the story of the making of a photojournalist. She is the youngest amongst her four sisters and two brothers all of whom have established themselves in different fields of education, art and culture. Sayeda, however, could not attend school regularly because of chronic ill-health. Surprisingly, this gave her the time to appreciate the bounties of nature.
While lying in bed like Tagore's Amol, Sayeeda would look out her bedroom window enthralled by the beauty of the trees, birds and mostly the Padma River. ""As a child, the varying colours of nature left an impression on my mind. I used to wonder how I could retain these images,"" she says.
The answer soon came to her through a black square box. Sayeeda's maternal aunt, Mahmuda Khatun Siddika, a poet, loved posing in front of the camera and getting her and her family's pictures taken. Being her aunt's little follower, Sayeeda became acquainted with the camera at a very young age.
Once while visiting Kolkata for treatment, she went to see an exhibition, ""Life"" by an American photographer. There she first came across the artistic aspect of photography. ""There were lots of pictures of people-- photos of their life, their feelings -- laughter, sorrow and grief. While watching those I began to comprehend that a photograph is not only a picture, it is an art,"" says the artiste in Sayeeda.
There she had a row with a friend, who rejected photography as a form of art. In response, Sayeeda threw a challenge at her friend saying, ""You just wait, one day I will show you that photographs too can be art."" Years later, Sayeeda's photograph of a woman praying in the first light of dawn in the solitary premises of the Delhi's Jumma mosque received an international award.
Sayeeda's first camera was a small Kodak box-camera, gifted to her by Lutfunnessa Chowdhury, a close friend of Sayeeda's elder sister, eminent academic Hamida Khanam. ""I took my first picture in Kolkata. I was about 13 or 14 then. My first subjects were two Kabuliwalas, passing by the Victoria Memorial,"" she fondly remembers. ""Rabindranath's 'Kabuliwala' had made an impression on my mind. As a result, I wanted to take a picture of a Kabuliwala,"" she explains.
Sayeeda's obsession with photography grew with time, which compelled her sister Hamida to get her a Rolleicord camera from the US. ""I still use Rollei. Although there are digital cameras now, I feel comfortable with a Rollei,"" she says giggling like a teenager.
Unlike photographers today, Sayeeda did not receive any institutional training on photography. Looking back to the Dhaka of the 50s' Dhaka, Sayeeda says, ""There were only two studios in Dhaka, one called Das Studio and another Jaidi's Studio."" Sayeeda often went to Jaidi's studio to get her photographs printed. Impressed by her photographs' composition, light and other aspects, Jaidi, the studio's owner, gave her foreign magazines on photography.
""He told me to look at the pictures taken by prominent photographers and note the exposure and aperture given below. At that time, photographs could not be taken without (adjusting) aperture and exposure. We had to take light, time and distance into consideration while taking a picture. He told me to go through that to get an idea and also to read the articles,"" says Sayeeda reflecting on her first photography lessons.
Jaidi also helped Sayeeda participate in the international photography exhibition held in Dhaka in 1954. Later on, one of her pictures received an international award at Cologne, Germany. She also won the first prize in 1960 in the All Pakistan's Photo contest.

Her career as a photojournalist began with Begum, the first magazine advocating the rights of Bengali Muslim women. Sayeeda's aunt Siddika introduced her to Mohammad Nasiruddin, founder of the magazine. He immediately assigned her to take cover pictures for Begum and also cover events organised by women across the country.
The opportunity opened the gate to a whole new world for Sayeeda. Soon her pictures began to appear in the pages of Pakistan Observer, Morning News, Dainik Bangla, Dainik Purbadesh, Sangbad, Ittefaq, Pakistan Khobor and others. She even started to cover important events as a press photographer. One of those event was when Queen Elizabeth II visited Bangladesh, the then East Pakistan, for the first time. ""I was the only (Bengali) woman in a simple blue sari with a camera in hand, amongst the hundred other fellow male journalists,"" she informs with a grin.

Her profession brought her close to many dignitaries. Some of them inspired her to move forward, braving all negative social barriers. One such person was the illustrated writer and film-maker Satyajit Ray. While working as the correspondent of the film magazine Chitrali in the 1960s, she showed interest in interviewing Ray. ""But Parvez Saheb (Muhammad Parvez, the then editor of Chitrali) did not show any interest,"" she reminisces. Not only her editor, everyone she knew in the cine-world, discouraged her, as Ray was known to be a very reserved person. Yet she went forward and called him, requesting an interview. He immediately agreed.

Surprisingly, Sayeeda not only got an exclusive interview from Ray but also became his family friend. Ray had encouraged her by remarking that very few women of the country chose the profession that Sayeda embarked upon. For thirty years, Sayeeda had captured the life and work of this talented man through her lens. After Ray's death, Sayeda's photography exhibition on Ray, held in India and Bangladesh, received many accolades.
When very few women of the country dared to even work outside the four-walls of homes, Sayeeda had journeyed around the country in a simple sari with a camera on her shoulders. ""Sometimes people used to throw stones at me, but I never shared these incidents at home,"" says the woman, whose courage broke through all social norms.
She even risked her life in pursuit of her passion. While attempting to take photographs of the defeated Pakistani Army on the eve of Bangladesh's freedom on December 16, 1971, she got into the line of fire. ""We (she and her companions) hid ourselves behind a mango tree while the machine-gun bullets cut through the air right past our ears,"" she relates, still shuddering at the memory, 41 years later.
To Sayeeda, photography has been a passion. She never worked for any remuneration. ""I used to get conveyance expense and money to cover the cost of developing the film,"" she says. Yet, she never lacked motivation for doing her job, which she continued while studying masters in Bengali and Library Science at Dhaka University.
Even today, Sayeeda often goes out on photographic expeditions, taking her life companion, the camera, with her. Photojournalists of Bangladesh look upon this brave and extra-ordinary woman for inspiration and courage.

","Sundari tree, one of the most extensively found mangrove species in the Sundarbans, are disappearing for various diseases, including 'top-dying disease' which has killed 15 percent trees since the 80s.
In the last 30 years, 1.44 million cubic meter Sundari trees worth Tk 2,000 crore have been destroyed after being affected by 'top-dying disease', said experts.
Increasing salinity in the water and soil of the Sundarbans due to climate change is another reason for which the number of Sundari, Passur and Keora trees has been declining fast.
Gewa and Goran are being grown in the forest replacing Sundari trees.Gewa and Goran are now grown in 50 percent new places.
There are 334 species of trees and plants in 4,143-sqkm area out of6,017 sqkm.
According to experts, mangrove forest is grown in such a special natural environment where there is a mixture of specific proportion of saline water and sweet water. The change in the specific proportion of saline and sweet water causes harm to mangrove forest. Increase of saline water is fatal for Sundari trees, which is happening in the Sundarbans.
Top-dying disease in Sundari, while heart-rot disease in Pashur and die-back disease in Kewara have been behind their fast extinction.
'Top-dying' and 'Heart-rot' disease attacked the tress in 6, 14, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38, and 39 compartments of the forest.
Noted water expert Ainun Nishat said Sundari trees have been dying due to the adverse effect of Farakka and lack of sweet water. ""There are now 85.67crore Sundari trees in the forest which have been on extinction.""
Md Bashirul-Al-Mamun, West Divisional Forest officer of the Sundarbans, said they found 30ppm salinity in the water which is decreasing the disease prevention capacity of the trees.
Dr Swapan Sarker, an associate professor at the Forest Environment Science of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST),in a research work mentioned that the diversity in the Sundarbans took a heat during 1986-2014. The number of Sundari, Passur, Shingra, Amur, Dhundal and Kakra trees are on the decline."

Brazil's space research agency Inpe recorded 6,803 fires in the Amazon last month, up from 5,318 in July 2019.
Although that is a three-year high for July, the figure pales in comparison to last year's peak of 30,900 fires in August – a 12-year high for that month.
Still, environmental groups say there are worrying signs of what may come, with the final days of the month showing a sharp spike. More than 1,000 fires were registered on July 30, the highest number for a single day in July since 2005, according to an analysis by advocacy group Greenpeace Brasil.
""It's a terrible sign,"" said Ane Alencar, science director at Brazil's Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM). ""We can expect that August will already be a difficult month and September will be worse yet.""
Environmental advocates blame right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for emboldening illegal loggers, miners and land speculators to destroy the forest with his vision of economic development for the region. Bolsonaro defends his plans to introduce mining and farming in protected reserves as a way to lift the region out of poverty.
This year, the president authorised a military deployment from May to November to combat deforestation and forest fires. He has also banned setting fires in the region for 120 days.
In 2019, Brazil instituted the same temporary policies later in the year, only after fires in the Amazon provoked global outcry in August.
Scientists say the rainforest is a vital defense against climate warming because it absorbs greenhouse gases.
Non-government organisation Amazon Conservation says it has tracked 62 major fires for the year as of July 30. Many of those came after July 15, when the fire ban went into affect, indicating it has not been entirely effective, said Matt Finer, who leads the NGO's fire tracking project.
The overwhelming majority of large fires, where elevated levels of aerosols in the smoke indicate large amounts of burning biomass, happened in recently deforested areas, with none found in virgin forest, Finer said.
Criminals generally extract valuable wood from the jungle before setting fire to the land to increase its value for farming and ranching. Natural fires are very rare in the Amazon.
Deforestation hit an 11-year high in 2019 and has soared a further 25% in the first half of 2020.
Earlier this month, scientists with US space agency NASA said higher surface temperatures in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean in 2020 were drawing moisture away from the southern Amazon.
""As a result, the southern Amazon landscape becomes dry and flammable, making human-set fires used for agriculture and land clearing more prone to growing out of control and spreading,"" NASA said on its website.
Fires are also worsening in the Pantanal, the world's largest wetlands, adjacent to the southern Amazon. In July, the number of blazes there more than tripled to 1,684 compared to the same month a year ago, according to INPE data, the most for that month since records began in 1998."

","A mutation of the coronavirus that is far more infectious than the original Wuhan strain has been detected in Malaysia, the health authorities said yesterday.
The D614G mutation was discovered by the Malaysian Institute for Medical Research in four cases from two Covid-19 clusters in the country - the Sivagangga cluster and the Ulu Tiram cluster, said health chief Noor Hisham Abdullah in a Facebook post on Sunday.
According to Datuk Dr Hisham, the discovery of the mutation means people need to be more careful and continue being disciplined in practising safety measures such as social distancing, personal hygiene and wearing of masks.
""It's found to be 10 times more infectious and is easily spread by an individual 'super spreader',"" he said, of the mutation.
He said the strain was found in preliminary tests and that follow-up tests would be conducted on other cases including the index cases of both clusters.
He added that the D614G mutation was discovered by scientists in July 2020, and could render existing vaccine research incomplete or ineffective against the new strain.
Nevertheless he noted that the swift action by Malaysia's public health authorities has controlled the virus' spread from the affected clusters.
Malaysia reported 26 new cases on Saturday, bringing the total number of infections so far to 9,175. No new fatalities were reported, keeping the death toll at 125."

HEALTH MINISTER'S MEETING WITH PM POSTPONED
The much-talked-about meeting on the trial of Chinese Covid-19 vaccines between the health minister Zahid Maleque and the prime minister Sheikh Hasina was postponed.
""The meeting will be rescheduled soon,"" Maidul Islam Prodhan, public relations officer of the health ministry told The Daily Star.
Last Wednesday, the health minister talked about this meeting during a discussion with Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal during the meeting of the cabinet committee on purchase.
Besides, the health ministry is also yet to take any decision on the collection of the Covid-19 vaccines when it becomes available in the market.
This issue was on the agenda of the health minister's meeting with the prime minister.
On July 18, Bangladesh Medical Research Council permitted the icddr,b to conduct the vaccine trial on 4,200 healthcare workers in seven hospitals.
But the trial became uncertain after the health minister and the health service division secretary last month said it would take time for the government to decide.
DR AMINUL HASAN AWARDED NEW POSITION
Dr Aminul Hasan, the immediate past director of hospitals and clinics at the health directorate before he was removed from his post, has been appointed the principal of the Dhaka Institute of Health Technology.
Sharmin Akter Jahan, deputy secretary of the health service division of the health ministry, confirmed this to The Daily Star yesterday.
On Sunday, the ministry issued the circular, where Aminul was asked to join his new workplace within three working days.
On July 23, Aminul Hasan was made officer on special duty (OSD) amidst huge criticism over the Regent Hospital scam.
Two days earlier, Prof Abul Kalam Azad -- the then director general of the health directorate -- also resigned from his post because of the same issue.
Last Wednesday, Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) started questioning the former DG and four other DGHS former officials including Aminul over various scams and irregularities in the health sector.
The three others are former deputy directors of the DGHS Yunus Ali, Md Shafiur Rahman and research officer Md Didarul Islam."

Babbling brooks, mossy arched bridges and hibiscus shrubs in full bloom -- this was the last location where Maj (retd) Sinha Rashed Md Khan was filming before he was killed in police firing on July 31.","Nestled between hills on one side and the sea on the other, Marishbunia village in Teknaf's Baharchhara union is pure beauty. Babbling brooks, mossy arched bridges and hibiscus shrubs in full bloom -- this was the last location where Maj (retd) Sinha Rashed Md Khan was filming before he was killed in police firing on July 31.
But for such an idyllic location, the atmosphere in Marishbunia is unnerving. All the witnesses named in the case, filed against the slain ex-army major by police, are from this village, and the inhabitants have been between a rock and a hard place since early this month.
While the investigation officer in the Sinha murder case against nine policemen arrested three inhabitants of the village, listed as witnesses in the police case against Sinha, police have tried to use the villagers as pawns and rattle them into silence.
The locals allege that the village is under intensive surveillance. Several villagers, all interviewed separately, claimed that vehicles of different law enforcement agencies have been making daily rounds of the village.
Yesterday, these two correspondents encountered a black-tinted-windowed Hi-Ace microbus -- the vehicle of choice for many a law enforcement agency -- zipping through the village streets around 11:30am. Villagers walking down the streets stopped to stare as the van crossed them.
Over the last two days, whenever the correspondents visited the village, they entered crowded tea shops to ask questions but people quickly slunk away.
This fear goes back to the day when the witnesses were picked up by plainclothes men, and the Teknaf police retaliated by harassing their families.
Md Mobarak, brother of Md Aiyas, the third witness in the police case, showed these correspondents the broken lock on the front door of their house, and their broken back door.
""This was in the early hours of August 12. Aiyas had been picked up around 3:30pm the day before. A plainclothes man, flanked by two policemen in uniform, came at 2:00am. They asked for Aiyas's wife, so she came to speak and answered questions about Aiyas.
""They left and came back an hour later -- this time we were fearful and we didn't open the door. They broke the locks, barged in and said Aiyas's wife needed to go to Teknaf Police Station with them,"" claimed Mobarak.
""We pleaded and they finally relented -- but not before getting her signatures on a sheaf of blank papers,"" he mentioned.
Aiyas' family also alleged that the circumstances surrounding how Aiyas had been picked up was also very unnerving.
Mobarak said, ""Around 3:30pm [on August 11], a group of people identifying themselves as journalists came to our house. They asked Aiyas to show them the spot where Sinha was coming down from the hill. I also went to the spot with my brother and saw Nazimuddin and Nurul Amin there.
""The people who identified themselves as journalists then said they must go to Cox's Bazar to meet a foreign journalist. I was left behind. Later, his [Aiyas] phone was found turned off. Around 10:00pm, he called to say he was well and asked me not to worry. The following day, Rab produced him before court as an arrestee,"" he mentioned.
On the August 11 night, policemen knocked the doors of their neighbours in the middle of the night. Right opposite Aiyas's home is a mud-walled house where his distant uncle lives.
""They came to our house around 11:45pm and banged on the front door. They couldn't break it because we use old-fashioned iron-rings to lock the door,"" said the relative.
The house next door, where a single mother lives with her young child, was not spared either. Another neighbour named Md Hashim said police came to his house around 8:30pm and they too kept the door closed out of fear.
Hamid Hossain, an auto-rickshaw driver listed as a witness in the police case, had left the area, claimed his brother Kamal.
""I don't know why police made my brother a witness… On the July 31 night, he had received a phone call from Aiyas saying they needed an auto-rickshaw to go to Shamlapur where a robber had been caught by police. He dropped them off in Shamlapur and came back.""
The following day was the Eid day. Police came around 10:00am while my brother was slaughtering a sacrificial cow. They took him to the police station in that state. He told me that they made him sign some blank papers,"" alleged Kamal.
Hamid has been hiding since then, he claimed.
Police also broke into the house of another witness, Nazimuddin, claimed locals.
There have been allegations that Nazimuddin's wife was forced to file a case claiming that her husband had been abducted by several men in a Hiace microbus. She was allegedly made to give her thumbprint on the documents.
When these correspondents visited her home yesterday, the entire premises were found empty. The neighbours said she fled the village the very next morning. 
While Rab Director General Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun was visiting Baharchhara yesterday, journalists asked him why police forced the wife of one of the witnesses to file an abduction case when in fact it was Rab that had arrested the witnesses.
In response, he said the agencies are working together. ""There is no lack of coordination among them.""
Khairul Islam, the investigation officer of the Sinha murder case and also assistant superintendent of police from Rab, described to the Rab DG how Sinha had come out of the car with his hands raised in the air when he was shot.
INVESTIGATION
At a press briefing in Cox's Bazar last night, Lt Col Ashiq Billah, director of Rab's Legal and Media Wing, said, ""An officer with a track record of solving 700 cases has been given the charge of investigation. Today we interrogated three members of the Armed Police Battalion, who were present at the check post on the day of the incident.""
They are sub-inspector Md Shahjahan and constables Md Razib and Md Abdullah.
""They will be interrogated further for the next few days. Legal action will be taken if their involvement is found.
""We will also investigate the narcotics case that police filed against Shipra Debnath, one of Maj (retd) Sinha's team members. We have prayed to the court for a directive on handover of Shipra's belongings to Rab. Her belongings are currently with police but they have not yet cooperated,"" he said.
""We also quizzed the four arrested policemen and three witnesses, and got vital information that we are currently analysing,"" added the Rab official.
Sources at the Cox's Bazar district jail said the four-member probe committee, formed by the home ministry, interrogated inspector Liaqat Ali, the prime accused in the Sinha murder case, and another accused, SI Nandadulal Rakhshit, from 10:30am to 6:45pm yesterday.
Another key accused, Pradeep Kumar, former OC of Teknaf Police Station, will be quizzed today, added the sources.
Meanwhile, Bangladesh Police Association issued a statement claiming that some vested quarters are out to malign the image of police, while they are in fact completely cooperating in the investigation."

He may not have written treaties in philosophy, literature and science but he brought to life a social and political epic that transformed the life of millions of his people and channelled history in a direction that Bangalees only dreamt of but hardly believed that it would happen.

","It is quite astounding that he lived for only 55 years (1920-1975) and achieved so much. He may not have written treaties in philosophy, literature and science but he brought to life a social and political epic that transformed the life of millions of his people and channelled history in a direction that Bangalees only dreamt of but hardly believed that it would happen.
If we allow the first 18 years of his life for personal growth -- the universal age for young adulthood -- then within the subsequent 37 years he developed himself to be a man of strong personal character, found his calling of freeing his people, convinced them to follow his path, unified them into a political force, emboldened them to demand justice and freedom, and finally led them to their destiny of creating an independent state -- together making for a most successful political life in modern history. 
In between, he spent nearly 13 years in jail, which amounted to almost one-third of his adult political life. To think that he organised, prepared and led his people to an armed struggle within a period of only two decades is nothing short of a miracle of achievement for any leader anywhere.
It is quite amazing how from the start he evolved into a people's man.
Public concerns always seemed to attract him. He almost instinctively converted what would start off as a demand of this or that group into his own, and within no time was able to bring all the votaries together and guide them to do something about it -- be it a matter pertaining to his school, his local football club and the like.
His taking charge of a situation came naturally and given his personality he would in no time become the central figure of any situation. What attracted others towards him was his dependability. He would not take up a cause today and forget about it tomorrow. If he made a commitment he would honour it. Along with dependability came the question of trust. He exuded trust because of his nature. Young boys who would gather around him, and later in life when people would flock to him, one of the main reasons would be the trust factor -- they could always count on him.
It was not in the birth of Pakistan -- in the struggle for which he was intimately involved both from his home town and in British Calcutta -- that he found his calling. It was in the gradual unfolding of the reality within which the Bangalees in East Pakistan lived and his intimate exposure to the oppressions they suffered that would strike a deep cord with his inner feelings thus transforming him from within.
The rights of the class-IV employees of Dhaka University, the founding of the Awami Muslim League, the Jinnah's speech triggering students and public outrage (""Urdu shall be the only state language of Pakistan""), the language movement and the wider issues of cultural identity, democratic rights, the fact of no election being held in the new state, military takeover and marginalisation of politicians and the throttling of almost all major dissenting voices transformed the young supporter of Pakistan of the early and mid-40s into the budding Bangalee nationalist of the late forties and early fifties. It was during this time that he came to instinctively feel that the ultimate solution of a separate country may be the only way for the true emancipation of his people.
The early, clear and powerful articulation of the aspirations of the people of East Pakistan came in the form of Ekush Dafa (21-point programme), the election manifesto of the Jukta Front (United Front) in 1954. The significance of this political programme is that it came within less than nine years of the formation of the new country.
It galvanised the people of the eastern wing and literally led to the obliteration of the Muslim League as a political party. Seldom the founding party of a newly formed state faced such a massive rejection by the people in so short a time. Writings were clearly on the wall only if anybody bothered to read it. This was especially significant considering that it was the Muslims of Bengal that gave the Pakistan movement its crucial and timely support and consequent credibility.
The coup by Gen Ayub in 1958 and the subsequent 10 years of military rule was the time of the real emergence of the steely, visionary and widely loved leader. His repeated internment, introspection and intellectual maturing while in prison, not to mention the hardening of his core beliefs and developing of his inner strength and the gradual clearing of mind as to steps to be taken next, led to what was his most brilliant move of introducing the famous six-points at the Roundtable meeting convened by dictator Ayub in Lahore.
The beauty of the programme was that it was simple, to the point and incorporated all the important demands of the people. In a short time, it caught the imagination of the people especially when the Pakistani rulers termed it as a secessionist ploy to destroy Pakistan.
What followed in the form of ""Agartala Conspiracy Case"" turned out to be a classic instance of political miscalculation and a Himalayan blunder. Gen Ayub's plan was to convict Sheikh Mujib of trying to break up Pakistan with India's help, thinking that such a case and its daily one-sided coverage in the pro-regime Pakistani media would distance Mujib from his people. We must remember that radio and TV were state monopolies then.
Here was the ""trust factor"" in magnificent display. Because people trusted Sheikh Mujib the exact opposite happened to what the military-bureaucratic rulers of Pakistan had expected. Instead of distancing, it galvanised the people behind him and skyrocketed his already huge popularity, firming his grip on public mind, and he, almost overnight, flowered into the Bangabandhu, the idol of his people.
The Pakistani genocide, Bangabandhu's confinement in Pakistani jail, our valiant freedom struggle, the resultant devastation of our country and its people, 10 million refugees in India, the Indian assistance, particularly the brilliant role played by Indira Gandhi, and our independence and complete victory over all odds, international support, and Sheikh Mujib's return at the helm of Bangladesh is well known to be repeated at some length here.
Bangabandhu's spell as the head of the government from January, 1972, onwards spawned many critics. When euphoria of just-earned freedom gave away to the harsh realities of a war-ravaged country, coupled with corruption (Bangabandhu's cry to reign in the ""Chatar Dal"", the blood suckers of the people) an element of disappointment started to creep in. This added with the post-draught famine of 1974, mis-governance and the turning of the country into a one-party state gave credence to those who worried about the country's democratic future.
But no failure of the government justified, in the remotest of sense, the nightmare that befell the nation with the brutal murder of Bangabandhu and his family, save his two daughters -- Sheikh Hasina, the present prime minister and Sheikh Rehana -- on the night of August 15, 1975, that we observe today.
Those of us who heard the boastful cries on Bangladesh radio that ""Sheikh Mujib ke hattya kora hoyechhey"" on August 16 morning, 1975, cannot still believe our ears that such a fate could have befallen a leader but for whose work our independence would not have come when it did.
In paraphrasing Churchill's tribute to the Royal Air Force that ""Never in human history was so much owed by so many to so few"" we can say that seldom in human history was so much owed by so many to one individual.
In my humble view, it would not be an exaggeration to say that Sheikh Mujib was not only the leader of our independence struggle, he was the conceiver, the designer, the planner, the energiser and the supreme visionary of it all. It is only the people of Bangladesh who have played a greater role, with the wholehearted involvement of the youth. There would not have been an independent Bangladesh in 1971 without the role of that single individual we lovingly call Bangabandhu.
So the question is why was he killed along with so many members of his family, and in such a brutal fashion that stupefies all civilised sensibilities.  What was his crime? Was his leading us to create an independent Bangladesh the crime for which he was so brutally taken away from us? I cannot find any other reason but this. Those who killed him wanted to destroy Bangladesh. Let us have no doubts about that.
As we commemorate Bangabandhu's 45th death anniversary we must strengthen our resolve to build the Sonar Bangla of his dreams, our dreams and one that we have pledged to our martyrs.
But what is that Sonar Bangla? In economic terms we have a come a long way. But our Sonar Bangla is that of freedom, of equality, or cultural flourishment, of human rights, of dignity of individual and groups, and above all, of democracy.
We do disservice to the memory of our Founding Father when we create the artificial democracy vs development debate. Development does not come in the absence of democracy because development is not just building roads, bridges and power plants etc. but of people's capacity to maintain their freedom and independence through self-reliance and self-confidence which comes from a sustained human development which is the only and real measure of development.
To building that Sonar Bangla let us dedicate ourselves in the centenary year of Bangabandhu's birth and on the 45th anniversary of his martyrdom."

","Shipra Debnath, a student of Stamford University and a crew member of slain Maj (retd) Sinha Md Rashed Khan, has fallen victim to cyberbullying, her family alleged.
A group of people, including some top-ranking police officials, have been posting her personal photographs along with provocative comments on Facebook, trying to assassinate her character, said her younger brother Shuvojit Kumar Debnath.
""It's a nasty game being played by some people, especially those who are holding responsible positions in our country,"" he said, adding, ""It comes from dirty mentality.""
Shuvojit said police seized all of their devices and belongings during the incident, and, while they still don't know whether any photos were leaked from those devices, it's a matter of concern.
""They [Shipra and Sefat] are the people who suffered the most after the [Sinha] killing incident. From the cases to jail, they are still going through trauma,"" he added.
Shipra, 25, was accused in a narcotics case following the killing of Sinha.
She and two other students of her university went to Cox's Bazar with Sinha on July 3 to take part in the making of a documentary by the former major, who was killed in police firing on July 31 night at Shamlapur police check-post, triggering nationwide outcry.
Shipra was arrested on charges of possessing liquor and marijuana, and was released on bail amid widespread protests.
Since her release, she has been bullied on social media by top police officials.
In one instance, Superintendent of Police Mostafijur Rahman of Satkhira shared some of her pictures on his Facebook profile on August 14 and took a dig at her character. In the post, he hinted that some more pictures may come.
A similar post was made by Mohammad Mizanur Rahman Shelley, SP (Dhaka Metro -- South) of the Police Bureau of Investigation, who also authored crime fiction books.
He tried to justify the case filed against Shipra by sharing similar photos of her.
Derogatory comments were then made on the post where people tried to assassinated the young woman's character. Some other police officers also endorsed the posts of their SPs.
Similar derogatory posts were also doing rounds on several Facebook groups and pages, some of which were administered by policemen, including ""Police e Janata, Janata e Police"" and ""Salute to BD Police"".
The posts by the policemen also touched off a firestorm of criticism by many social media users.
Rezvi Ahmed Ocean commented under SP Shelley's post: ""Who gave you the responsibility to do moral policing?""
Sheikh Fazleh Elahee wrote that the pictures posted by the police officials do not even prove that someone was possessing drugs at that time of the incident.
Shahriar Mursalin Deep reminded the SP of the Digital Security Act 2018 by mentioning some of its section.
SP Mostafijur could not be reached for comments on his phone despite several attempts.
Asked, PBI SP Shelley said, ""Yes, such comments can be made [by police]. What's the problem?""
About sharing personal pictures, the police official said, ""I didn't take the photos. She posted those pictures publicly herself on her different social media. You can see the links…""
The police official termed his post merely a ""general statement"".
This newspaper called and texted Assistant Inspector General (Media) Md Sohel Rana several times yesterday evening for comments but he did not respond.
Women rights activists expressed concern and asked how policemen are sharing personal pictures of the young woman in a bid to defame her when the women in the country are already in a socially vulnerable state.
Rights activist Khushi Kabir said the case against Shipra is under investigation but police are provoking others to humiliate her by sharing photos and making such comments.
""Compared to a normal person violating laws, when a member of a law enforcement agency commits such crimes, it becomes a serious offence because they are the people who are supposed to enforce the laws.
""If Shipra had committed a crime, her character still has nothing to do with her crime. Publishing such photos to humiliate and assassinate the character is just a proof of their loose morals. This cannot be expected from police officials,"" she said.
Speaking to The Daily Star, Salma Ali, human rights lawyer and president of Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association said, ""When they see a case related to women, be it an incident of sexual harassment or even rape, everyone points their fingers at the woman's character, which only proves the deep-rooted patriarchal mind-set that is still prevailing in the country.""
She added that here, the case is under investigation and sharing Shipra's personal photos of her partaking in activities with her friends doesn't prove that she is guilty and the police have no right to circulate her photos on digital platforms and instigate public defamation.
In the DSA 2018's section 29 (1), it is strictly mentioned that if a person commits an offence of publishing or broadcasting defamatory information as described in section 499 of the penal code 1860 on any website or any other electronic format, then they will be sentenced to a term of imprisonment not exceeding three years or fine not exceeding Tk five lakh, the lawyer said."

ACC Deputy Assistant Director Mohammad Sahajahan Meraz interrogated Shahed for about five hours at the commission's Segunbagicha headquarters.
Earlier, the ACC filed a petition with Dhaka's Senior Special Judge's Court to allow the commission to interrogate Shahed. The court, presided by Judge KM Emrul Kayesh, allowed the ACC to interrogate him on a seven-day remand.
On July 27, Meraz filed a case against Shahed for misappropriating about Tk 2.71 crore loan from Farmers' Bank.
Shahed, who is now in jail, came to the limelight after he was found involved in issuing fake Covid-19 certificates following a raid by Rab on Regent Hospital. He went into hiding and was later arrested by Rab from Satkhira.
""We've gleaned information regarding misappropriation. For the sake of proper investigation, we cannot disclose it right now,"" said Meraz.
According to the case statement, Shahed bribed former audit committee chairman of the then Farmers Bank Mahbubul Haque Chisty -- accused in five cases filed last year for illegally amassing Tk 135.45 crore -- and gave him Tk 35 lakh to get the loan.
Shahed opened a current account with Gulshan Corporate Branch of Farmers Bank on January 11, 2015.
On the same day, he applied for a Tk 2 crore loan to buy an MRI machine worth around Tk 3.4 crore for his hospital.
In his application, Shahed pledged to keep Tk 1 crore FDR as mortgage against the loan.
On January 15, 2015 at the 21st meeting of the committee, chaired by Chisty, the memo was produced and approved.
After three days, the Credit Risk Management Division sent the loan approval letter to the Gulshan Corporate Branch.
Meanwhile, that same day, Shahed deposited Tk 35 lakh in cash at the Bakshiganj Jute Spinners Ltd account with Farmers Bank at the Bakshiganj branch.
Chisty's son Rashedul Haque Chisty, who is managing director of Bakshiganj Jute Spinners, withdrew the money on two separate days -- January 18 and January 20, according to the ACC.
Shahed did not repay the loan.
Later, the bank reconciled the loan with Shahed's Tk 1 crore FDR. The total outstanding, including loan and interest till July 15, 2020, stood Tk 2.71 crore.
Chisty, his son Rashedul and managing director of Regent Hospital Ibrahim Khalil are also made accused in the case.
Earlier, the ACC filed another case against Shahed for misappropriating Tk 1.51 crore loan from NRB bank."

Of the deceased, 79.14 percent are men and 20.86 percent women.
Bangladesh's fatality rate stands at 1.3 percent while the recovery rate is 57.7 percent. The country reported its first Covid-19 cases on March 8 and the first death on March 18.
Labs around the country have conducted 1273,168 tests so far, including the latest 12,849, and found 20.46 percent of the samples to be positive.
Nasima said 2,067 more patients have recovered during the 24-hour period, bringing the total number of recoveries to 150,437.
The fatalities include a child below 10. Twenty-three of the deceased are aged between 51 and 70 years.
Novel coronavirus cases were first reported in China in December last year. In March, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic.
There are now over 19.7 million confirmed Covid-19 cases globally, with more than 729,000 fatalities and 12 million recoveries, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

","Stamford University student Shipra Debnath, also a crew member of slain Maj (retd) Sinha Md Rashed Khan, has promised to file cases under the Digital Security Act against police officials and others who made her life miserable by circulating her private photos on social media. 
In a video statement yesterday, she sought justice for the killing of Sinha and the attempts made to assassinate her and her colleague Shahadul Islam Sefat's characters.
After Sinha's murder on the night of July 31, she alleged, police went to their resort and seized both their laptops, three hard drives, mobile phones, monitor, desktop, camera, and lenses.
""But those were not in the seizure list. Now I don't know how to get those back,"" she said.
""I have been noticing for the last several days that some of my personal photos were posted on social media by tailoring and editing those in Photoshop to create a different meaning.
""Stealing photos from our social media profiles and [seized] devices, some officers with perverted minds shared those on Facebook and other social media platforms. Fake Facebook and Instagram IDs were created in my name,"" Shipra said.
""The people who have made my personal life miserable by sharing photos and making videos, I will take proper action against each of them under the Digital Security Act. I swear…"" said the 25-year-old student.
Shipra was accused in a narcotics case following the killing of Sinha. She along with two other students of her university and Sinha went to Cox's
from page 1
Bazar on July 3 to take part in a documentary being made by the former major.
Sinha was killed in police firing on July 31 at Shamlapur police check-post, triggering an outcry in the country.
Shirpa was arrested on charge of possessing liquor and marijuana, and was released from jail on bail amid widespread protests.
Since her release, she has been exposed to cyberbullying. Two superintendents of police posted Shipra's personal photos on their social media accounts, taking a dig at her character. A Supreme Court lawyer on Sunday filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the two police officers' actions.
""I want justice for the murder of Maj (retd) Sinha. I want justice for the character assassination of me and my colleague. I want law enforcement agencies to adopt positive lens,"" Shipra said in the 8:56-minute video.
The attempt to assassinate her character was an insult and humiliation to every working woman in the country, she noted, adding that it was done intentionally to divert attention from the killing.
""Isn't it [the attempt at character assassination] a punishable offence under the law of Bangladesh?"" she asked.
""I am a student and I also work, besides studying. In an independent country, doesn't any woman have the right to live like according to her will while not harming others?"" she asked.
Shipra said that she is not blaming the entire police force as there are many honest officers.
""But if the officers accused in killing and the officers with perverted minds engaged in defaming a woman are not identified and brought to book, the nation will hold the entire police force responsible,"" she said.
Describing the fateful night of July 31 and its aftermath, Shipra said about 10-12 police members entered their resort after 12:00am without any search warrant or any female police.
Without permission, they searched their rooms but did not give any information about the whereabouts of Sinha and Sefat even after repeated questions, she said.
Around 2:30am, some plainclothes men appeared at the scene and Shipra repeated the question.
""They then said, 'Yes, Sinha is dead'.
""Without giving any reason, they took me and my other colleague Tahsin Rifat Noor to Ramu Police Station. Then in the afternoon, they took us to the office of Cox's Bazar SP… In this whole period, I requested every police officer to allow me to see Maj (retd) Sinha for the last time… but my request fell upon deaf ears.
""Around 8:00pm, they escorted me in a police van. Then I was sent to jail. There, I came to know I am accused in a narcotics case,"" Shipra said.
She said she met some women in the jail whose husbands met the fate of ""crossfire"" by police.
""While I was coming out of jail, they requested me to talk about them too. This responsibility still haunts me,"" Shipra said.
In the video, she requested authorities concerned to investigate and talk to the helpless and tortured women in the jail.
Speaking about Maj (retd) Sinha, she said he was fond of travelling and a man full of dreams and adventure.
""As an army officer, he was an all-rounder… He served the prestigious SSF for a long time. He worked for the protection of our honorable prime minister. And today, how logical is it to question his intelligence, character and team choice?"" she asked.
Shipra said Maj (retd) Sinha was the chief coordinator of their documentary team and took every decision surrounding logistics.
""In one word, he's our guardian.""
When asked, Lt Col Ashique Billah, Rab's legal and media wing director, at a press briefing in Cox's Bazar refrained from making any direct comment about the video and said that the elite force is only in charge of investigating the murder of Maj (retd) Sinha.
""Whatever came in the media or went viral on social media, is a private matter of Shipra Debnath. As a conscious citizen, she may take help of the law,"" he said."

","Many countries halted some or all international travel since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic but now have plans to re-open travel. Here are some key considerations for national health authorities when considering the gradual return to international travel operations.
The decision-making process should be multisectoral and ensure coordination of the measures implemented by national and international transport authorities and other relevant sectors and be aligned with the overall national strategies for adjusting public health and social measures.
The gradual lifting of travel measures or temporary restrictions should be based on a thorough risk assessment, taking into account country context, the local epidemiology and transmission patterns, the national health and social measures to control the outbreak, and the capacities of health systems in both departure and destination countries, including at points of entry.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that priority should be given to essential travel for emergencies, humanitarian actions (including emergency medical flights and medical evacuation), travel of essential personnel (including emergency responders and providers of public health technical support, critical personnel in transport sectors such as seafarers and diplomatic officers), and repatriation.
Cargo transport should also be prioritised for essential medical, food and energy supplies. Sick travellers and persons at risk including elderly travellers and people with chronic diseases or underlying health conditions, should delay or avoid travelling internationally to and from areas with community transmission.
There is no ""zero risk"" when considering the potential importation or exportation of cases in the context of international travel. Therefore, thorough and continuous risk assessment and management will help identify, reduce and mitigate those risks, while balancing the socio-economic consequences of travel measures (or temporary restrictions) against potential adverse public health consequences.
The decision process should include an analysis of the situation, taking into account the local context in countries of departure and destination. The following factors should be considered: local epidemiology and transmission patterns, the national public health and social measures for controlling the outbreaks in both departure and destination countries; public health and health service capacity at national and subnational levels to manage suspect and confirmed cases among travellers, including at points of entry (ports, airports, ground crossings) to mitigate and manage the risk of importation or exportation of the disease; and the evolving knowledge about COVID-19 transmission and its clinical features.
Because the COVID-19 epidemiological situation will vary among countries, international travel, carries different levels of risk of exportation/importation of SARS-CoV-2 virus, depending on the passenger's country of departure and country of arrival. Four scenarios are considered:
• No cases: Countries/territories/areas with no reported cases
• Sporadic cases: Countries/territories/areas with one or more cases, imported or locally detected
• Clusters: Countries/territories/areas experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common exposures
• Community transmission: Countries/area/territories experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to:
- Large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission chains
- Large numbers of cases from sentinel laboratory surveillance
- Multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area.
In addition to the public health risk posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, countries should also take into account other economic, political and social considerations when deciding on resuming international travel. Such considerations should be assessed with relevant stakeholders and appropriate experts and authorities.
Working across sectors is essential for the proper implementation of public health measures. The transport sector is central to travel operations, but the involvement of other sectors such as trade, agriculture, tourism and security are essential to capture all the operational aspects associated with the gradual resumption of international travels.
Countries should regularly reiterate the risk assessment process and review the capacity of their public health and other relevant sectors while gradually resuming international travels.

www.thedailystar.net/law-our-rights/news/august-15-case-against-the-doctrine-revolutionary-legality-1946873,Law & Our Rights,2020-08-18T00:00:00+06:00,2020-08-18T00:00:00+06:00,August 15: A case against the doctrine of revolutionary legality,"Upon the murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Father of the Nation, on August 15, 1975, the office of the President of Bangladesh was seized and eventually, the government powers were assumed by the usurpers.","Upon the murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Father of the Nation, on August 15, 1975, the office of the President of Bangladesh was seized and eventually, the government powers were assumed by the usurpers. The very act of usurpation of powers, among others that followed, was declared illegal in the judgment handed down by the Appellate Division in the case Bangladesh Italian marble Works Ltd. v Government of Bangladesh and others (2005), otherwise known as the 5th amendment case.
Professor Hans Kelsen with his doctrine of revolutionary legality implying that a successful revolution can amount to a law-creating act and can change the basic norm or the grundnorm, made his appearance in the said judgment. While both the High Court and Appellate Divisions expressed disapproval for illegal seizure of powers through unconstitutional means, the High Court Division made the observation that Kelsen can only be used to explain past incidents and that 'a Judge in deciding a case may call upon many a legal theory in establishing his own point of view but should not regard it as a precedent.' The Appellate Division declared that the 'will of the people' is the pole star of our Constitution and the same cannot be whittled down by any usurpers. However, unlike the High Court Division, the Appellate Division did not express its view with regard to the application of Kelsen as a normative principle, in specific. It will not be out of place to mention that the Appellate Division, seemingly in arguendo, went on to opine that there were no pretexts on August 15, 1975 (considering that the Vice-President was available and the parliament was in existence) that could justify the assumption of powers.
Kelsen penned his theory of revolutionary legality in the book 'General Theory of Law and State' (1949). He observed that when a group of individuals attempting to seize power by force, succeeds in doing so, and when upon such seizure, the old legal order ceases and a new legal order begins to be efficacious, because the individuals whose behavior the new order regulates actually behave in conformity with the new order, then the new order is to be considered as a valid legal order. On the other hand, if the said group of people fails, if the order they have tried to establish remains inefficacious, then, their undertaking of seizing power by force is to be interpreted, not as a legal, law creating act for the establishment of a (new legal order) but as an illegal act, as the crime of treason, according to the old order.
As opposed to a normative principle, Kelsen's doctrine is a descriptive theory of law entailing a mere juristic proposition, which is neither beyond the pale of controversy and/or fallacy nor is to be taken as a legal norm presupposed to be relevant for judicial decisions.
The inherent fallacies of the doctrine of revolutionary legality were underscored in the landmark case of Asma Jilani v Government of Punjab (1972), a decision which was referred by both the Divisions of our Supreme Court in the 5th amendment case. In that case, the Pakistan Supreme Court iterated the futility of Kelsen or any doctrine or theory in order to validate or justify an unconstitutional act and unequivocally held that the said doctrine cannot be invoked in Pakistan.
The Court went on to refer to Professor Dias, Laski and Stone, among others, with the aim of rejecting Kelsen altogether. First, the Court observed that Kelsen postulated his theory on successful coups d'etat as law-creating acts from the perspective of international law and that his presumed hierarchy of norms does not apply to a dualist domestic legal order. Second, the Court thwarted the idea that the efficacy of a legal order would automatically confer validity upon it.
Interestingly, the Court also observed that ""Kelsen [..] does not contemplate an omnipotent President and Chief Martial Law Administrator sitting high above society and handing his behests downwards"" and that Kelsen did not intend to imply that every person who was successful in grabbing power could claim to be the source of law. While these well-articulated observations by the Jilani Court can be lauded, they imply a keen interest taken by the Court in interpreting Kelsen as well and this interpretation of what Kelsen's doctrine 'contemplates' or 'intends', in a way, presupposes that the doctrine is a legal principle/norm, pertinent/relevant for judicial decisions. What was advanced in arguendo by the Appellate Division in the 5th amendment judgment too, lends credit to the presupposition. This is something that Professor Julius Stone had feared more than half a century back.  
In mid-1960s Professor Stone and Professor Kelsen got involved in a scholarly debate. In a 1964 book 'Legal System and Lawyers' Reasoning' and a 1963 article 'Mystery and Mystique in the Basic Norm', Stone critically questioned Kelsen in general and in a way persuaded him to clarify his position.
Finally, Kelsen made out his points with regard to his theories through yet another article 'Professor Stone and the Pure Theory of Law' (1965)-
""Never, not even in the earliest formulation of the Pure Theory of Law did I express the foolish opinion that the propositions [..] 'bind' the judge 'in the way in which legal norms bind him.' Insofar as the judge in performing his function of applying and creating law adopts a theory of law, his position is the same as that of any lawyer. And as far as the lawyers are concerned, I tried, of course, to convince them that my theory is correct.... But this does not mean that I considered the propositions [..] as legally binding.""
While finding fallacies in Kelsen's doctrine of revolutionary legality is fine and can indeed be lauded as a judicious exercise, rejecting it altogether is what seems appropriate. Considering Kelsen as just another jurist's thought and not a normative principle for guiding judicial decisions, is also immensely necessary. Moreover, search for pretexts in not justifying the necessity (of invoking Kelsen) (even if as an arguendo, as was done by the Appellate Division in the 5th amendment case) needs to be done away with.

Even during normal times, this involved setting out a basic routine for myself and the kids for weekdays, and even weekends,"" said Nadia Tabassum, regional manager at Unilever Bangladesh, and mother of three boys aged 11, 7, and 3. ""I thrive on routine and for me, a single unplanned day can truly create havoc!""
So, one of the biggest hurdles that working mothers like Tabassum faced, especially in the early days of the pandemic, was the complete meltdown of all established routines.
Career women have always shouldered a heavy burden of responsibilities and social expectations, long before COVID-19 was a thing. A working woman was already juggling work, family, and life, but at the onset of the pandemic, their responsibilities suddenly increased. Overnight, a working mother became a teacher and a childcare provider, duties that she could otherwise relegate to schools, grandparents, and nannies during her office hours. In Bangladesh, many families let go of their part-time domestic helpers during this pandemic to contain the spread of the coronavirus. For many working mothers, therefore, this meant cooking for the family and doing the household chores, too.
""In Bangladesh, mothers are expected to shoulder the entire responsibility for child rearing. This invisible burden leaves the mothers drained,"" said Vidita Gazi, a communications specialist at a development agency. Gazi believes that family and society should be more sensitive towards mothers that are teleworking, during this pandemic.
""Managing both work and family during this lockdown is taking a toll on the physical and mental health of working mothers,"" she added. ""A neglected mother means a neglected child, so we must take care of our mothers first.""  
With workplaces, schools, and day-care centres closed, Bangladeshi expatriates, especially working mothers, living around the world are also finding it difficult to balance career and family. The stories of their struggles sound similar to the struggles that are being experienced by working mothers living in Bangladesh.   
""It gets quite difficult to focus on my work when there are two kids at home who want and need constant attention. My 13-year-old daughter keeps asking me to help her with her home-school assignments, and my four-year-old son wants me to play with him all the time,"" said Dr Haseen Cherry, a British-Bangladeshi microbiologist, who lives in Ipswich, England. ""The lockdown has meant additional household and childcare responsibilities for me.""   
Then there are productivity pitfalls, too. ""I have experienced loss of work productivity during this lockdown,"" said Reema Akhter, a Bangladeshi Australian, who is a human resources specialist in Sydney.
Akhter has two children, aged nine and two. ""On top of cooking and doing essential household chores during the day, I have to look after my two children, especially my toddler, who needs a lot of care and attention. All this makes it difficult for me to concentrate on my office work,"" she said. 
Akhter says she finishes her office work late at night, when both kids are asleep, so this pandemic has also meant working longer hours for many mothers. ""There are days when I fall asleep with the laptop in my bed,"" she said.
""At home, we now work in chaotic and unsuitable work spaces, which results in falling work productivity,"" she added.
There are many working mothers out there who are finding it exceptionally challenging to keep a work-life balance during this lockdown, because not all workplaces are equally accommodating.
""My employer thinks that I do not need a lunch break anymore, just because I am working from home,"" said Vidita Gazi. ""I need a lunch break now more than ever, because I have a husband and two kids at home, who expect me to be at the dining table with them.""
Others like Samreen Abid, who is a mother of a 9-month-old infant and works at a private financial institution in Dhaka, goes to work five days a week, because her company does not have a work-from-home system in place. ""I am always worried about my safety, the safety of my child, and other members of my family,"" she said. 
For single mothers, the situation is even more difficult, as often, they are the sole primary caregivers of the children.
Jafrin Sabrina is a single mother and a lecturer at a private university in Dhaka. ""In addition to adjusting to a new kind of instruction method at work that is online teaching, I am also home-schooling my 9-year-old son, who now needs more attention with his school work. Then, I also have to make sure that my house is running smoothly,"" Sabrina said.
""The COVID-19 pandemic is taking a toll on everyone, but for women like me, who have no intimate partners to share the struggles around this unprecedented situation, it has been particularly challenging,"" she added.
However, most working mothers we interviewed are happy about certain results of the lockdown, and are actively looking for coping mechanisms as well.   
""To stay mentally active, I have been doing a lot of online learning and reading. There are some fantastic courses available on different platforms like Degreed and LinkedIn, which my employer has made available to its employees,"" said Nadia Tabassum.
Tabassum also said that she has used this lockdown to work on her cooking and baking skills.
Like Tabassum, Jafrin Sabrina also spends her leisure reading. ""Rising Strong by Brené Brown and The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle have had profound motivational effects on me during this pandemic,"" she said.
Our working mothers said that in spite of the tremendous amounts of stress that they are experiencing every day, they are enjoying their family time, something that they seldom enjoyed when they worked out of home and the kids went to school.
""My husband and I now sit down and discuss a wide array of subjects, something that we never did in the last 10 years,"" said Vidita Gazi. ""The lockdown has also made it possible for me to spend more time in the company of my husband and children.""
Reema Akhter also thinks that if there has been any positive effect of this pandemic, then it must be that it has allowed families to come closer. ""My two-year-old son has never seen both of his parents at home 24/7. To him, it is a fun and wonderful thing that he can get to see his parents whenever he wants!""
Trying to juggle work and family in a pandemic situation is more than just stressful, but our career women are finding creative ways to cope with their stress; they are re-defining what a productive day should look like; and they are using the current situation to their advantage by connecting with their loved ones on a deeper level.

This is not because they are difficult in themselves so much because oftheir content. ,"Good books – even as they are arresting – are often hard to read. This is not because they are difficult in themselves so much because oftheir content. Human societies are callous and viscous; cruelty, greed, and selfishnessaremanifest across the world, and one purpose of stories is topicture this layout. This makes for hard truths, often, and this is what I mean when I say good books are hard to read. It is also in such terms I read A Burning(Alfred A Knopf, 2020, p. 293), the debut novel by Megha Majumdar, a thoroughly good book.It is hard to readprecisely because it accurately delineates with bleakness and compassion contemporary India. It is a story of prejudice and selfishness, as they are tied to everyday aspirations, and the ghosts such acts of calculations let loose in India today.
The novel centers around the stories of three people in a city in West Bengal, clearly Kolkata even though the city is not named. The first protagonist is Jivan, a Muslim girl, charged with terrorism in connection to an attack on a train at the Kolabagan Station, close to the slum where she lives with her parents. The second is Lovely, a hijra, dreaming of being an actress,and whom Jivan sometimes tutors in English. The third is PT Sir, a physical education instructor at the all-girls school Jivan attended,an ancillary teaching staff who becomes involved with the rising Hindu nationalist party in the state. Each of the threecharacters represents a different thread in the tapestry of India – the idea of rising to the middle class, the idea of becoming a star, and the idea of becoming a political leader. Their storiesplay out in the complex context of current-day Indian life, widespread anti-Muslim violence and inequality, the undeniable cult and power of celebrity, and the victimization of all those who are notHindu men.
It begins with Jivan posting a comment on Facebook calling the government ""terrorists"" – late at night when most of our most careless mistakes are made. She is arrested the next day and charged with being part of the terrorist attack on the train, with the government using details of her Facebook conversations with someone they claim is a terrorist recruiter as evidence against her. Because she is poor and Muslim, Jivanis afforded no leeway and is quickly sucked into the opaque legal system that she cannot afford to navigate. Her hopes of freedom rest on her telling her lifestory to a news reporter, which she believes will accrue public support, and the facts of the day in question, provided by Lovely, whom she was taking books to at the time of the attack.
As the book barrels forward through Jivan's story, it also narrativizes the lives of Lovely and PT Sir at the same time. Each of the two, one could read, as characterizing certain figurations of appeal in the ideological spectrum: the liberal and the conservative. Lovely navigates the cruel life of a hijra in Kolkata, trying to make money through blessings and begging, and paying most of it to go to acting lessons. She hopes that she will become a famous film actress, and in that way give voice to the loss she lives with because of who she is, a hijra who is poor and cannot ever have children and a family. PT Sir, aligning with the rising status quo of Hindu nationalism, rises quickly within the new political party. He hopes to make more of himself in life and believes in making society better, especially in improving the apathetic circumstances  of schooling. He comes to be represented as a politician who provides an authentic voice of the people; written as particularly effective because he can delude himself about the cynical nature of political parties, wrapping themselves in high-minded rhetoric of nationalism and social responsibility. How these figures end up impacting Jivan's story is the immediate thread of the novel, but Majumdar's art as a writer is to flesh out all three characters' trajectories in evocative thematic significance to contemporary India.
Stylistically speaking, A Burning is compulsively readable. It is told in short chapters, written in economic prose, alternating perspectives and foci on characters. Majumdar seems to be a skilled writer who knows our short attention spansintimately and recognizes the needto move briskly to appeal to our constraints. This compositional approachhas become increasingly popular in recent years, with accomplished practitioners not necessarily losing out on the craft of storytelling in the process. In my college writing classes, for example, I often assign Trevor Noah's memoir, Born a Crime, precisely because it communicates complex issues inconcise,terse chapters.I have found that my students can read the book more effectively because the chapters are so short, which helps them get through sections in one sitting and so actually helps them read better. I believe this is to be the same for A Burning. I read it quickly, within in a few days, largely because I was able to get through individual chapters in one sittingsince each ran four to five pages at their longest. A Burning unfurls so much of itself in showing the moments making up its story precisely and incisively, enabling the subtlety of the meaning and consequencesof events toonlybecome fully apparent as the narrative progresses and the events accumulate. It reads, in some ways, like a mystery-thriller, but this genre-identity belies its real significance as a great piece of fiction by a tremendous new writer.
In its bleakness and pathos, A Burning is evocative of The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy. There are clear parallels with this book and the Roy classic; both are powerful debut novels highlighting how badly Indian society treats its least. Whereas in Roy's novel, violence upon the Dalit community is highlighted, in A Burning, the scapegoats du jour are shown to be the Muslims, the ""beef-eaters."" Both can be read as fatalistic (a hallmark of Indian fiction), but both also flesh out how others' choices over their own lives act upon ourselves–even as their consequences remain largely unknown and hidden from ourdirect perception. Majumdar, like Roy, can humanize our vulnerabilities as they are connected to our corruptions, and this makes her novel resonate beyond the political to what makes the essence of our personhood. Fostering empathyis often provided as a rationalizedfunction of all goodbooks and Majumdar, in Burning, makes a powerful new claim on this terrain. It is a story of urgency, told urgently, and that needs to be read urgently.

","(Swadhinata, Ei Shobodota Kibhabe Amader Holo)
How Freedom Became Our Own Word
 
A poem is about to be written;
Millions of excited, rebellious, impatient listeners Waited for the happening
From dawn in the park's open field a sea of people has been wondering—
""When will the Poet show up?""
 
This Children's Park didn't exist that day
This garden beautified with flowers and trees didn't exist that day
This languid drab evening didn't exist that day
So how was that particular evening?
How were the Children's Park, benches, its trees, flowers and garden
In this park that is at the heart of Dhaka city that day?
 
I know dark hands strove to erase all memories of that day
Thus it is I can see in this adverse poet-less expanse today
A poet set up against a poet
A field set up against a field
An evening set up against an evening
A park set up against a park
A March set up against amarch….
 
""O child of the coming age"", O poet of the future
Swaying on the Children's Park colorful swings
You'll come to know all one day
It's with you in mind I leave behind this tale of that greatest of evenings!
On that day this park looked completely different
It neither had this park nor this garden full of flowers—nothing of the kind!
Only, as a slice of an unbroken sky can be, the horizon was flooded that day
The vast grass-covered field wasthen lush green, so very lush green!
The lush green dear to our hearts and our beloved freedom had melded
With a vast grass-covered green field that day!
 
Wrapping foreheads and wrists in red-cotton cloth
To this field had come rushing workers from metal foundries
Ploughs and yokes on shouldershad come swarming bare-bodied farmers
With weapons snatched from policemen had come radiant youths!
With death in their fists and dreams in their eyes had come middle, lower middle-class people
Andsad-eyed clerks, women, old people, whores, vagrants as well
And children like you who had assembled to gather fallen leaves   
A poem was to be recited—people waited eagerly for him—
""When will the poet show up?"" ""When will he be here?""
 
""After centuries, centuries of struggles,
With the resolute gait of a Rabindranath
The poet came next and stood on the people's stage
In the twinkling of an eye and in sparkling light water buoyed a vessel
As the heart began to sway a sea of people felt a tide coming their way
All doors had opened; who could suppress that thunderous voice?
Making the sun-lit people's stage tremble, the poet read out his immortal poem—
""The struggle this timeis for our freedom
The struggle this time is for independence!""
 
From then on ""freedom"" became our own word!
 
Now that It's August Cry Out in Sorrow
 
Now that it's August, cry out in sorrow Bengalis!
 
I know you weren't allowed to mourn for a long, long time
I know, hapless Bengalis, you weren't able to cry at all
For twenty-one long years, but you can do so now!
Cry your hearts out now for the time to mourn has come
Clear the debt of sorrow you've piled up for over two decades
In tears that can flow completely freely now!
With the tears of pent-up passion released from your hearts
Let Bengal's delta be flooded and swept away.
Most people have no idea how striking shared tears
Can look on them. Let everyone know that truth now.
Like crickets chirping soulfully across earth
Let your clamorous cries pervade and overwhelm it.
Cry out soulfully, making earth quiver with your cries!
 
Citizens of an ill-fated country's horn of happiness
Cry out now like a hungry baby deprived of milk
Cry out now like a lonely sister grieving for a lost brother
Cry out now like a dear daughter wailing for her dead father
Cry out now like poor people who've lost all in ruinous floods
Cry out now like a mother who has just birthed a still-born child
Cry out now like a wailing old man who has just buried his own son,
Returned home, and is flailing helplessly on his courtyard floor.
You couldn't mourn when you wanted to but cry out now
And let go of your pent up and till now impotent anger and pain!
 
After twenty-one years the sun called Mujib has burst through
Clouds and now blazes in Bengal's skies again. Not in celebration
But with funeral cries greet him now. Cry, Bengalis, cry!
 
Like the immaculate juice oozing out of an uprooted baat tree
Let tears ooze out of your eyes and flow down your face
Like the warm juice of a date palm tree that has been tapped
Let the tears pent up in your bosom trickle down to its earthly urn.
 
Twenty-one years have gone by and August has come again
August is the cruelest month
August is the month of mourning, soaked in sin, harsh, cruel
Free it from its sins with overflowing tears!

Productivity tools are anything that provides physical or digital assistance in organizations, time management, storage, etc. If you try to google what apps you should download on your phone to aid you in your quest to make yourself more efficient, you will come up with at least 15 different things you need to reach the optimum level of work output when you are working from your home or office's desk, or 10 apps that you need to boost productivity. Following these suggestions might backfire on you if you do not create a space that has room to be flexible and relaxing. At the end of the day, productivity is about getting more things done in a lesser amount of time, not about spending more money and creating a false sense of work efficiency. Here are some reasons as to why that may happen:
Need for Space

Your desk or workspace needs an area for you to move around while you work. This movement can be anything, a few examples may include where you like to keep your highlighters while you study, being able to change the location of your mousepad if you use one or the position of your laptop that you want to be able to change depending on the hour of the day. If you have a binder for your files and an organizer for your other paper supplies, that might take up too much of the upper shelf region of your desk. Many minimalists encourage not overcrowding your upper shelf because it creates a false sense of pressure on you because of having a big mass looming over your head. Having too many items around you while you are trying to learn something or get your creative juices flowing might lead to you getting distracted when you are trying to concentrate. Losing concentration in the middle of work is what leads to procrastination, as your mind tries to escape when you are using it more than regular. Lesser number of items on your table will give you more room to work with fewer causes for distractions, which will increase your desire to work.
More Choices More Confusion
If you have fewer items for your work, it will allow you to choose quickly than you would have with multiple options. Office supply companies will often promote sales on big collections of organizers or your favourite sharpies that will supposedly increase the quality of your work life. Reality might turn out to be quite different because the more options you have, the more time you will waste behind deciding which suits your mood today the most. While personalizing your experience from multiple options may seem like a fun thing to do, you will end up wasting time trying to make that choice.
Myth of Multitasking 
Popular apps like Trello, Slack, Wunderlist are continuously promoted as a tool that will aid in multi-tasking management and multitasking is seen as an ultimate way to boost productivity. But studies have shown that multitasking actually ends up decreasing efficiency. When you start a new task and your consciousness engages itself to get used to the work, it goes through a mental gear of control. If you switch between your tasks, it takes longer for your mental makeup to cope with the adjustment and bring your focus, costing your precious time to be wasted.

He said he will have to stay in quarantine for two weeks… His mother and I were waiting for him when we suddenly received a phone call… He told us he is in Kashimpur jail,” narrated Shaheen’s disappointed father to a reporter of The Daily Star.","""Last month, we got to know Shaheen has come back. He said he will have to stay in quarantine for two weeks… His mother and I were waiting for him when we suddenly received a phone call… He told us he is in Kashimpur jail,"" narrated Shaheen's disappointed father to a reporter of The Daily Star. Shaheen worked as a pipe-fitter for four years in Bahrain. Not being aware that an application for visa extension has to be launched before its expiration, Shaheen was arrested by the authorities in Bahrain when he went to file for the extension. It was not only this one family's hope of celebrating Eid together with their long absent loved one that was dashed; 219 other families across the land endured the same heartache. Subsequently, another group of 36 deported migrants were detained.
At a time when these families are struggling to cope with the consequences of the unexpected returns of their migrant family members, the latter group's unpredicted incarceration is devastating. The families are given very little information about the detainees. Meanwhile, their deeply concerned spouses and siblings try to figure out how they would secure their release, worried parents pass sleepless nights wondering what the future holds, and restless children pester their mothers of when they would get to see their fathers.
That the returned migrants were sent to Kashimpur prison directly from the quarantine centre was perhaps the only clear information these families have. The detainees were charged under the much contested Section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ""for suspicious activities"". The Investigating Officer of the case justified the move saying, ""All had gone abroad to work but got involved in different criminal activities instead"". Meanwhile, a court rejected bails of those who lodged petitions and on July 10, instructed the police to submit a report within 10 days. The deadline was extended. On August 4, the Turag Thana Police asked for 15 more days to submit the report. In the interim, the pardoned repatriated workers continue to remain in the high security prison.
Police sources have informed the media that they may be charged with sabotage and terrorism. The Home Minister has confirmed that there are allegations of ""conspiracy"" against these individuals. His ministry sources inform that in the General Diary lodged with Turag thana, the police has claimed that by engaging in criminal activities, these people have ""tarnished the image of the country abroad"". It further claimed that the authorities did not have their exact addresses and so if they are released, they may disperse and commit crimes, including murder, robbery, terrorism and sabotage.
At the court, while justifying their detention, the police claimed that during their stay in quarantine in north Diabari, they were engaged in consultations with various groups to commit ""anti-government and anti-state"" activities, including violent acts. Hence, they appealed to detain the accused until their investigations are completed.
It is noteworthy that the police could not provide any credible evidence of the charges being framed against them. In a report from The Daily Star, the investigating officer was quoted as saying ""We don't know yet what the crimes are, but we have sent 'enquiry slips' to the police stations of the villages they came from to probe on their behalf"". The Officer in Charge of the Turag thana did not mince his words when he said, ""We are investigating their crimes. It's only after the investigation that we will be able to ascertain who is guilty and who is not.""
This en masse incarceration of the pardoned, deported migrant workers after finishing their quarantine has raised some serious questions pertaining to the protection of rights and liberty of individuals.
Firstly, can this be an acceptable proposition that each and every member of a squad of 255 persons would engage in hatching a conspiracy, albeit in groups, at a time when they would be too eager to return to their loved ones after a prolonged and rough experience abroad? Secondly, isn't it imperative on the part of those levelling such serious charges to provide at least a shred of evidence of the alleged ""suspicious activities"" to the court to justify their plea for detention? Thirdly, if indeed crimes were planned, then does not it rest on the authorities to establish the motive? One fails to understand what axe would a band of returnee migrant workers have to grind against the government and the state, when the state authorities quarantined them for their own safety and safety of their loved ones?
Fourthly, the candid admission of the police that they were not aware of the actual crimes committed and was waiting for responses from the police stations of the villages of the accused also appear to be frivolous. One is not sure what information would be forthcoming from the villages of the migrants. Are the police expecting the families of migrants to divulge the crimes their migrant family members had committed? Or are they more interested to know if the concerned migrants had committed crimes prior to their departure abroad? If it is the latter case, then should this not have been an issue when passport and immigration clearances were granted to them? And finally, is not the investigating officer grossly wrong when he says all in the pack have veered towards committing crimes in destination countries instead of working there?
The assumption that if these people were released they could commit ""murder, robbery, terrorism and sabotage"" and ""other violent acts"" is also deeply flawed. This is simply because barring one or two cases, all those detained in Kashimpur prison were in custody in their countries of destination either for administrative infractions (such as overstay of visa or work permit) or minor offences such as consuming alcohol, robbing a tire or misusing telecom rules.
Criminal records obtained from the Middle East by credible media outlets inform that their ""crimes"" fall into two broad categories: being in an ""undocumented status"" or ""petty narcotics charges, including consumption of liquor"". Those belonging to the second category received state pardons commuting their sentences. Bangladesh embassy officials in Kuwait and Qatar confirmed that all inmates of drug charges secured state pardons from the Emirs. The counselor (labour) in Doha was quoted by The Daily Star as saying that barring one or two murder convicts, most inmates were in jail on narcotics charges and had served two-thirds of their sentences. Some were convicted for rather innocuous offences such as selling cell phone talk time, which is widely practiced in every nook and corner of Bangladesh, and not deemed as a crime.
This bizarre tale also raises issues regarding the just application of the law. The crimes were committed abroad and all concerned had served more than half of the terms before they were pardoned. They were not returned under any extradition arrangement and as free persons. Rudimentary knowledge in jurisprudence informs that a person cannot be tried and punished for a crime more than once. Any attempt to put them on trial in Bangladesh will be a travesty of justice.
Jurist Shahdeen Malik has denounced the move as ""entirely illegal"", maintaining that if someone has served a sentence abroad or his sentence is commuted, then making him serve a fresh tenure at home does not have any legal foundation. He further asserted that mere suspicion is not a sufficient ground to deprive a person of his liberty. Former chair of National Human Rights Commission Mizanur Rahman of Dhaka University noted ""such acts of the executive branch are damaging the minimum democratic space that people are enjoying. It is ominous for our state, (enjoyment of) human rights, and for the common masses.""
""All citizens are equal before the law"" stipulates Article 27 of Bangladesh's constitution. One of the principal aims of a key European Union project on migration being implemented by a leading NGO of the country (following due clearance by the government of Bangladesh) is to ""(a)ssist returnees to become financially independent through tailored economic reintegration plan."" Bangladeshis in irregular status in Europe is the principal target group. The question therefore arises—if the government is okay with programmes for reintegrating this cohort of irregular migrants, what drives it to resort to such draconian measure against those (most, if not all) who went abroad through legitimate channels following procedures laid out by both governments of origin and destination, to eke out a living, but were forced by circumstances to fall into an irregular status? Often, it is the Kafeels (employers) and the facilitating agencies at the destination end who create conditions for such irregular status, without migrants having any redress.
So far, the predicament of these returnee migrants have drawn little attention from public representatives, the agencies that are meant to uphold the rule of law and deliver justice, the passionate public intellectuals, the otherwise vibrant civil society and the media in general. It is time we all stand by these defenceless subalterns, prove our commitment to the principles of rule of law and equality in treatment, and acknowledge that they too are equal stakeholders of the state.

www.thedailystar.net/opinion/news/ending-violence-against-children-must-be-national-priority-1946637,Opinion,2020-08-18T00:00:00+06:00,2020-08-18T00:00:00+06:00,Ending violence against children must be a national priority,"According to the Global Status Report on Preventing Violence Against Children 2020, each year, half of the world’s children (approximately one billion) are affected by physical, sexual or psychological violence, suffering injuries, disabilities and death.","According to the Global Status Report on Preventing Violence Against Children 2020, each year, half of the world's children (approximately one billion) are affected by physical, sexual or psychological violence, suffering injuries, disabilities and death. The report was published in June this year by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, UNESCO, the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on Violence against Children and the End Violence Partnership. It charts progress in 155 countries, including Bangladesh, against the INSPIRE framework (a set of seven strategies for preventing and responding to violence against children).
This is the first time ever that governments have self-reported on their work to address violence against children. While there are some methodological concerns, the report provides a good overview of the progress that countries have made in implementing interventions to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets on ending violence against children, and makes recommendations for the future.
Violence is a serious violation of children's rights, which affects their health, education and development. This also has serious economic impacts. According to an estimate, violence against children results in a GDP loss of USD one trillion every year. The report suggests that while nearly all countries (88 percent) have key laws in place to protect children against violence, less than half of countries (47 percent) said these were being strongly enforced.
In Bangladesh, there is a culture of impunity. Perpetrators of violence against children are hardly brought to justice, which contributes to continuing violence. In the past month alone, 89 percent of children (1-14 years) in Bangladesh experienced violent discipline. Due to my work on protecting children from violence, I am painfully aware of how socially acceptable the practice of corporal punishment is. In addition to physical and mental violence, children of our country are subjected to rape, torture, child marriage, trafficking, abduction etc.
A lack of proper coordination across departments that are responsible for children, health, education, social work etc. makes it challenging to address violence against children in a holistic way in Bangladesh. This is combined with inadequate professional capacity and limited budgetary allocations. Shouldn't we do more and be better at ending violence against children?
Between 32 percent to 37 percent of countries considered that victims of violence could access support services. Bangladesh has also responded positively. However, the ""perceived reach"" is quite low; 26 percent of countries provide programmes on parent and caregiver support and 15 percent of countries had modifications to provide safe physical environments for children. Bangladesh does not have interventions in these areas.
The report has been published at a time when most countries are struggling to cope with Covid-19. This global pandemic is primarily a public health emergency, but it has a lot of secondary impacts on children's education, health and protection, in the short and long run. Due to prolonged school closures, restrictions in movement and social isolation, children have lost their regular lives and support networks. Unequal gender relations and patriarchal norms are important causes of violence against women and children, and these get magnified during a humanitarian crisis, making them more vulnerable.
From media compilation reports by various child and women's rights organisations and networks in Bangladesh, we have seen an increase in domestic abuse, violence against children, rapes, child marriage, cyber-crimes, trafficking etc during Covid-19. This must be considered while we respond to the crisis.
The report highlights that countries have mechanisms to support national violence prevention work. But only one-fifth of the countries have fully funded national action plans or plans that include specified indicators on the prevalence of violence against children with baseline and target values. Decision-makers in every country accept the need to scale up their efforts.
Isn't it tragic that violence against children continues to shatter children's lives even when we know what works in preventing it? The report suggests that drastic effort is needed to scale up our collective support for evidence-based prevention efforts if we are to end all forms of violence against children by 2030. I believe strong political commitment is required to make this happen.
The report makes a number of recommendations. Some are worth highlighting for Bangladesh. An appropriately resourced agency should be mandated to coordinate multisectoral action to end violence against children. Countries should prioritise data collection on key violence-related indicators as part of regular SDG reporting and use these to set measurable targets in data-driven national plans. Governments should ensure a renewed commitment to the implementation and enforcement of laws. Funding for evidence-based approaches to ending violence against children must be increased and be embedded in medium-term expenditure frameworks in national and sub-national levels. All these recommendations can be implemented if we make ending violence against children a priority.
Violence against children risks efforts to achieve SDGs. Let us be committed to create a society where all children can be free from violence and realise their potential. There is a need to establish a functional and well-funded child protection system (mandated by the Children Act 2013 of Bangladesh) at all levels to protect all children from all forms of violence. The government should lead the process and parent/caregivers, teachers, community members, health professionals, social workers, civil society, media, academia etc will have to play their roles to prevent and respond to violence against children. It is very important to change social norms and learn to treat children with respect and dignity. A social movement is required to stop tolerating violence against children.
One of the recommendations of the report asks governments to initiate policy dialogues to review the status of their violence against children prevention programmes with relevant stakeholders from government, NGOs and international partners. They are encouraged to use the country profiles and national recommendations included in the report as starting points. Will there be a policy dialogue in Bangladesh to rigorously review where we are and identify what more needs to be done to bring momentum to end violence against children?

www.thedailystar.net/opinion/news/justice-sinha-can-initiate-justice-others-too-1946597,Opinion,2020-08-18T00:00:00+06:00,2020-08-18T00:00:00+06:00,Justice for Sinha can initiate justice for others too,"“The Police does not shoulder the responsibility of any misdeed committed by an individual”, claims the Bangladesh Police Service Association (BPSA), a representative body of the members of the police cadre in the country. ","""The Police does not shoulder the responsibility of any misdeed committed by an individual"", claims the Bangladesh Police Service Association (BPSA), a representative body of the members of the police cadre in the country. The statement was aimed at calming tensions created due to the unfortunate extrajudicial killing of Major (rtd) Rashed Md Khan Sinha in Cox's Bazar by a police team.
It must be noted that till now, none of the members of the BPSA have been named in the Sinha murder case. However, the irony was, on the day the association issued the statement, one of its members, an SP of Rajshahi Range, was sued in Dhaka for the abduction and extortion of a businessman. Besides, some more stories appeared in the media in the last few days alleging police excesses, extortion, corruption and another extrajudicial killing in the same Cox's Bazar district, which appears to be a pattern throughout the country.
The BPSA statement claimed that Bangladesh Police took action against the wrongdoers earlier and that this practice would continue in future. But the facts do not bear out such statements. In fact, this particular mentality—that any wrongdoing should be apportioned on individuals rather than the enabling structures and cohorts—foster more abuses, more corruption and an erosion of public trust. No wonder the opening lines of a decade-old report of the International Crisis Group (ICG) on Bangladesh police still remains valid and relevant. The report said, ""After decades of misuse and neglect, Bangladesh's police are a source of instability and fear rather than a key component of a democratic society. Human rights abuses are endemic and almost all Bangladeshis who interact with the police complain of corruption.""
The ICG in that report warned that if the police continue to be used for political ends, the force may be damaged beyond repair at a great cost, not only to Bangladesh's citizens but also to current and future elected governments. Given the role the police has played in crackdowns on opposition and silencing dissent, over-enthusiastically acting like members of the ruling party during elections and extracting impunity from the political masters, one may reasonably assume that we have reached the state that was predicted by the ICG.  
The outcry for justice for Sinha is a wakeup call to look beyond one particular crime, and instead identify the institutional faults. It should start from rejecting the notion that all crimes committed by members wearing the badges of a security force have nothing to do with the institution. The recent backlash against institutional racism in policing in the United States has forced politicians and police to review and reform policing. The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement has resulted in police forces being defunded by quite a few local authorities, which for long ignored the need for change.
Luckily, so far, racism is not that visible in Bangladesh but power and influence have become major factors in policing. In this context, a possible backlash on policing for the few and privileged should not be discounted. Our focus should be now on reforming the police and ensuring justice for all. For too long we have focused on symptoms and not the cause. Justice for Sinha should pave the way for justice for all the victims of extrajudicial killings and abuses.
The most frequent answer the authorities love to utter is that reforms require in-depth study and time. But the fact is that a comprehensive study under the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) was undertaken and its recommendations, which were submitted in July 2012, remain largely ignored. Among many other findings, its most crucial analysis is that the Police Act 1861 places great emphasis on accountability to the government but less importance on accountability to the law and to the community, which is against democratic principles. The study says that in a democracy, ""police have an obligation to be accountable to the law, elected representatives and the community"". It clearly states, ""notwithstanding the Bangladesh Police's move to establish the Police Internal Oversight body, failure of the 1861 Act to institute some form of independent and external review of police misconduct is a glaring omission"".
It is true that the current government, during the early years in its first term, brought in some measures which some people felt were encouraging and positive. The most notable among those were improving pay and provisions, and an apparent attempt to involve communities in policing. But, like any other half-hearted reform initiative, it failed miserably. Community engagement became another tool to make police work for the ruling party, instead of the society. Monthly meetings at police stations with so-called ""civil society"" representatives became farcical and in some cases, conspiratorial against opponents and rivals of local MPs and leaders of the ruling party.
Without an external oversight mechanism, as the forces of accountability gradually shifted more to the party in power, abuse of power for financial gains became rampant as well. Doubling of salary and other financial incentives did not work to discourage corruption; rather demands and greed reached an unprecedented level.
The impunity issue was best summarised last year by the United Nations Committee on Torture (UNCAT) when it observed, ""The Committee is further concerned at reports that there is no independent body authorised to carry out investigations into allegations of torture by officials, so investigations are carried out by officers from the same units or within the same official hierarchy as the alleged perpetrators, resulting in conflicts of interest.""
Among many other recommendations, the most important one it made was establishing an investigation mechanism to handle complaints regarding torture and ill-treatment by law enforcement officials that is independent of law enforcement agencies, including the police hierarchy. It also called for legislations ensuring effective victim and witness protection. The need for such legislation can easily be felt if anyone looks at the abuses and harassment by members of the police force on social media against the co-workers of Sinha. Its recommendations include ensuring an oversight body's monitoring role in the progress of investigations into allegations of torture. We should now make it a priority that these recommendations are fully implemented as soon as possible.
In an extraordinary move, the administrative probe body set up by the government into Sinha's killing is holding a public hearing into the circumstances and issues related to the incident. The hearing may not have any bearing on the criminal investigation and prosecution, but it shows that similar public hearings in all other alleged extrajudicial killings are possible. Therefore, a public enquiry into all alleged extrajudicial killings headed by a Supreme Court judge with judicial powers should be instituted as soon as possible. Establishing a judicial probe does not require any new legislation. We urge the government to establish a judicial commission and make the truth come out. Justice for Sinha should open up the way to justice for others too.

Once considered the largest dome in the world, Ayasofia remains a symbol of the harmony that Turkey exudes: a merging of the East and West, a coming together of inter-connected faiths that a country like Turkey, with its many rulers and colourful history can only result in.","I was living on the Greek island of Crete in March 2018 when I heard of the Turkish President Erdogan reciting verses from the Quran at the iconic Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. The Greek were in a state of agitation and every little kafenio or road side cafe had their TV channels tuned in to the news and it was a barrage of heated words and elaborate gestures at their neighbouring country's activities.
I too grew pensive at the collective atmosphere as most Greeks I encountered, expressed sheer passion towards the Hagia Sofia, considered one of the greatest symbols of the Greek Orthodox Church. A country littered with remnants of the Byzantinian era, the Greeks have eulogies and songs honouring Hagia Sofia, dating from the times it was built. Many Greeks have been wanting its conversion back into a church but then there were those, who loved it for the inter-faith harmony that it exuded. As a graduate of Heritage Management, my only concern was losing the integrity and authenticity that the status of a museum brought to a site of such cultural and historical significance.
Hagia Sofia saw many changes and additions and even functioned as a Catholic church for a short duration then went back to being a Greek orthodox church, until its final conversion into a mosque, as the Ottomans conquered Constantinople in 1453 CE. By the time of Kemal Ataturk's secular Turkey, the city was known as Istanbul and the mosque, Ayasofia. For the first time since the Ottomans, the red carpets covering the artwork on the floors were uncovered and Ataturk declared it a museum in 1934. In July 2020, President Erdogan saw to its conversion back into a mosque and Ayasofia held its first mass Friday prayers in more than 80 years on July 24, 2020.
This conversion had been in the offing for a few years, but I suppose we were all hoping against it as the popular opinion was that a UNESCO World Heritage Site would surely be subject to more stringent measures. It needs to be noted that this is not the first Byzantinian church being converted into a mosque by Erdogan but the fact that he went for a site so internationally recognisable as a symbol of Turkey, was what set this move apart. The Taj Mahal is to India what Ayasofia is to Turkey and so much more. Once considered the largest dome in the world, Ayasofia remains a symbol of the harmony that Turkey exudes: a merging of the East and West, a coming together of inter-connected faiths that a country like Turkey, with its many rulers and colourful history can only result in.
The move itself has many implications from political to rousing of religious fervour, both motivations which should be kept away from a heritage site of such international significance. UNESCO could do little to stop this move except express their disappointment but the carpets have rolled back on to the floors of the mosque and the symbols covered in cloth during prayer times. Turkish authorities have assured maintaining it as a museum, without an entrance fees and allowing entry for people of all religions, but it remains to be seen how the changes will be applied.
Ayasofia has been repaired multiple times over its 1,500-year presence and the Fossati brothers in the 19th century added placard discs with the names of Allah, the Prophet, his two grandsons and the 4 Caliphs. Sketches were made of all the mosaics but these were later covered for their protection from vandals, but also because locals had expressed their displeasure, since it operated as a mosque back then. With its status reverted back as a mosque, any changes would still be noticeable but to what extent these changes are done, is of concern.
Ayasofia's influence on the Muslim world has been more architectural than spiritual as many mosques, are influenced by the Ottoman style of architecture. This credit mainly goes to the famed architect Sinan, who built the Selimiye Mosque in 1575 CE and all later influences are thus, an offshoot of Sinan's greatest inspiration: the Hagia Sofia.
Evangelos Kyriakidis, director of the Chicago-based Heritage Management Organization explains that ""there is no punishment, and the worst that can happen is that [UNESCO] revokes the world heritage status. A travel warning that you are going to a country that does not look after world heritage could be damning, but it is very hard for [UNESCO] to do that because it needs the money of the parties that are involved -- in this case Turkey.""
In a world where we have witnessed rampant losses incurred by mindless acts of terrorism and the more recent refusal to accept the whitewashing/ colonisation of our histories (the tearing down of white supremacist statues), this is the time we need to most preserve what is left of our shared heritage. Ayasofia gave us a chance to relive the Constantinople of the 6th century CE and the later day Ottomans. The influence of the Ottomans to the East and the Byzantinians to the West, congregated under the domed roof that was thought to be held by a golden string from the heavens.

","As National Photographer's day is observed on August 19th, what better occasion to try your hand at automotive photography?
Here are some recollections and a bit of life hacks to make automotive  photography one step easier from my short stint in trying to act like  one.  
GEAR DOES NOT MATTER- 
The best camera is the one  you have with you, right now. A little paraphrasing by Casey Neistat.  Forget fancy Mirrorless and the league of DSLRs. Modern smartphones can  pack a decent punch, and can even hold a massive candle to professional  cameras. Download a manual camera app if you're feeling frisky and  you're good to go, as it almost gives you the same control over  parameters that a conventional camera has. Practice on model cars if you  do not have the 1:1 subject. Diecast photography is still a niche  category which makes it all the more rewarding. Moreover, smartphones  make it learning to take pictures all the more user intuitive, which  brings me to my next point.
ANGLES-

Stick to the  conventional profile shots, while being creative with it. Enable the  ""grid"" from your camera settings. Learn the rule of thirds (place the  subject on the third imaginary line on the grid. Angle and composition  goes hand in hand. Repeat after me; there are no rules to photography.  You do you. Meanwhile, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Be  inspired and don't be afraid to copy your favourite photographers.
Time it- 
One thing photographers will usually rave on and on is about golden  hour. That time of the day when the sun starts sinking into the horizon,  and you're treated to a warm spectrum of colours ranging from yellow to  orange (and sometimes, a purplish red when the weather machine breaks).  That being said, one thing us photographers hate more than vampires  hate garlic naan is shooting under the mid-day sun. Not to say  completely avoid it, but stick to golden hour (sunrise and sunset) to  get the perfect equilibrium in lighting.
Edit-

So you have  done and dusted the lion's share of the work. Now comes editing. Again,  there is nothing wrong with copying others. (While I'm about to give an  appreciation shoutout to my favourite automotive photography related  youtubers, my idols; Mark Riccioni, Alex Penfold, Richard Pardon, Daniel  Bronshteyn to name a select few, deserves your follow on Instagram, as  do I @thatbrowncarguy) One photographer I find everyone copying is Peter  McKinnon and North Borders (Mike), (I do too). Do check out North  Border's YouTube channel. They're a mix between light hearted banter  with the mates while diving deep into hands on, POV style tutorials on  all types of automotive photography that you can and will dive down the  rabbit hole into. Generally speaking, try not to alter the colour of the  car, a mistake I see photographers quite often (hey, while we're  pointing fingers, let's point a massive index to my face, I used to do  that all the time!). Try to be faithful to what you think looks best.  (Also side note, if you're still big on HDR photography in 2020, you  should consider going back to the future, atleast 5 years ago. HDR has  no place in 2020. Capeesh? Capeesh.)
Feedback loop-

The  only way to exponentially increase your learning curve is to ask for  constructive criticism to whomever you can. What floats your boat, may  not float everyone else's."

Wow, okay. This is not looking good. Your brain is in absolute shambles and in dire need of some serious damage control. For starters, I cannot bear to witness these harmful bouts of Over-Inflated Confidence that you are currently experiencing, so I will straight away redirect your thoughts to the All-My-Failures-Listed-In-Ascending-Order Compartment. I promise you these undesirable feelings should begin to subside in no time. Good heavens, it also looks like you're severely deficient in Feelings of Inadequacy as well. Quick! Drop everything, go stand in front of your mirror, strike a power pose, and repeat after me, ""I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH"" three times before things go up in flames inside here.
I'll Do Whatever It Takes
Phew, that was close. You should be grateful I was there in the nick of time.
Anyway, now that I have taken care of the more pressing issues, there are some other things I ought to address while I'm here. Much to my dismay, it appears that you have returned to giving yourself Positive Affirmations once again. Sure, I understand that there is a sense of comfort in tricking yourself into believing that you landed this project due to your hard work, but don't you think it may be time to face the truth? There has clearly been a colossal mistake. Fine, I will say it myself. Everything that you achieved so far (which isn't much, to begin with) only happened as a series of mere flukes. I repeat, mere flukes.
What's that? Oh, you're shamelessly gorging on the lies of your friends, family members, and even your boss now? Do you have any idea how frustrating it is for me to watch this? I spend my precious time giving you invaluable lessons on Deflecting Praises and Dismissing Accomplishments but evidently, all my efforts go in vain. Listen, I know you think they care about you, but ask yourself, do they know you like I do?
To make matters worse, these same people will have you believe that I (the ever-faithful voice inside your head) am the outcome of perhaps some childhood trauma, or the patriarchy that constantly gaslights women, but I feel compelled to tell you… that is a load of nonsense. I am purely the outcome of your own overwhelming mediocrity. That is the plain and simple fact.
Won't You Embrace Me Already?
Look, I have religiously guided you through every important step in your life, I have carefully safeguarded your dirty little secret of being a pseudo-competent phony, all I ask from you now is that you do not make my job any more difficult. We have danced this self-destructive Macarena for years now. I have my own life too, and I would much rather do something else than work tirelessly to protect you from the perils of Positive Thinking and Self-Actualisation. So please, help me help you and we can finally crush your spirit together.
Or else one of these days, (God forbid) you might actually end up doing something worthwhile.

But who is this... youth?","What does it mean to be a youth? 
To be able to relate to depressing indie music for hours trapped in our bedroom? Or trekking to the top of a hill and reveling in one's achievement with a great view? Or constantly trying to find your place in the world—a world that looks increasingly complex as days go by?
The term ""youth"" has become somewhat of a buzzword that people use as part of their everyday jargon. Different businesses, competitions, events and campaigns have the word thrown in using funky fonts, graffiti-style designs and forceful use of teen lingo to try to appeal to the younger crowd. But who is this... youth?
""Youth, to me, is a state of being,"" says 17-year old Farhan Rashid. ""Just how babies crawl before they learn to walk, youth is a stage we all must pass to become an adult. Youth therefore is an important part of life where we develop emotions, logic, perspectives and all that really make us human.""
When you're in your teen years, your priorities are different. Not having a moment to yourself between school, tuitions and extracurriculars can be overwhelming. Yet the beginning of youth is spent discovering yourself and finding your personality. What type of music do you identify with? What colours do you wear? And who do you call your friends at school and around your neighbourhood?
It is during our youth that we navigate some difficult situations; nobody said coming of age was easy. Experiencing emotions like sadness or having anxiety for the first time, whether it happens to you or somebody around you, is a struggle in and of itself. Growing family responsibilities and stepping up to your duties at home can be daunting. Watching your parents age before your eyes is as scary as growing up is exciting. More importantly, the changes don't end there.
""To me, youth and being young is more about a feeling. It's a feeling of caring less, having fewer responsibilities and not worrying a lot. Just being lively without trying. I miss it the most because I feel like my youth is going away fast,"" 23-year old Nusrat Zahin confesses.
Perhaps you were never involved in personal finances before, now suddenly you find yourself looking for part-time gigs or a student who you can pass on your very limited knowledge to. Handling, negotiating and saving your own money makes you feel like more of an adult. It's something which every youth aspires to be. At 18, I ventured out for the first time and joined a school as a part-time reacher. I was the youngest staff member and wasn't taken very seriously. However, this independence and discovering what you are like is arguably the best part about youth.
Youth is of course a transitory state. No matter how much we try to make sense of our experience as a young person, none of us will be one for long. So when do we leave our youth? As responsibilities keep piling up and realities catch up to us, we find ourselves aware of the uncertainties of life. Scared of the decisions we're taking, doubtful of the commitments we're making, and not knowing if we can live up to our own expectations. Career, investments, health and our own families suddenly start demanding more from us. And as we move along our path going from one state to another, we give in and oblige.
Nevertheless, it is said that youth can change the world. Why so?
Perhaps because nobody believes in their own potential as much as a young person does. The kind of selfless giving and optimism the youth has is why young changemakers are unparalleled. They are doing commendable work all around the world. From raising money for charity and voluntarily teaching disadvantaged children to running multi-million dollar companies, the youth is taking giant leaps in making our world a better place for future generations.
There are several issues the current generation care for. Climate change, mental health, human and animal rights, women empowerment and education are some of these crucial causes. We interpret the world differently and have our vision about the planet and its inhabitants and raise our bold voices to show the power of youth. When you see young people distributing food to the poor in the sweltering heat of Dhaka or holding online sessions to try to educate more people at different locations about a misunderstood topic, that is the power of the youth. When students forget their differences and join hands to stand against injustice or use their skills and knowledge to create new frontiers in science, that is the power of the youth.
Youth is not being scared of the countless flights of stairs when the elevator is closed for maintenance. Youth is being able to function a whole day during finals with only two hours of sleep. Youth is making travel and business plans with each group of friends you have with little planning about the practical side of things. Youth is about coming from a small town and fulfilling dreams to make it in the big city. And youth is, of course, having a strong ideology and going out there to change the world because you believe things can be changed.
To me personally, youth is a state of mind. It's feeling invincible knowing you have your whole life ahead of you. It's knowing you have time to explore the things you love and do the things you've always wanted to do. That I will have choices to make and decisions to take. Life is a journey and I—a youth—am ready; I can grow, learn, experience and shape my life as I go along.

At least, on paper.","The last few months of any given calendar year is nothing short of pandemonium for high school seniors who plan to apply to universities abroad. Students run from one office to the other, trying to produce and procure the best possible essays and recommendation letters respectively. No matter which country they apply to, you'll notice they have one thing in common: a plethora of colourful books will safely be cocooned in their arms, or perhaps, be sneaking out from their constantly bulging school bags.
The aforementioned books all have one purpose: helping pupils 'crack' standardised tests. You see, having a standardised test to grade students makes sense on a lot of levels. Scholars all over the world study under a hand and lap full or curricula, all of which have their own level of difficulty and grading system. Having one test that provides the same questions, conditions and most importantly, grading system aides admissions officers immensely by successfully bringing all applicants under the same roof. At least, on paper.
After conducting many studies, College Board – the non-profit organisation that provides the SATs – has concluded that one's test scores are indicative of their college-readiness. The studies were based on the new SAT, which is more reflective of what students are learning in class unlike the previous version, which was more about testing one's intelligence. A video by Vox adds that students' test scores are also an indicator of their wealth inequalities. Students in poorer neighbourhoods are likely to go to underfunded and under-resourced schools whereas the opposite is true for students in wealthier neighbourhoods. These factors lead to a 260-point difference between the test scores of rich and poor students. The problem doesn't end there, higher-scoring pupils are more likely to get into more selective or prestigious schools, leading them to earn more when they enter the job market. Lower earnings for students from low-income households, who go to less prestigious schools or community colleges create a vicious cycle of poverty. Additionally, students from low-income households may have to work when they're not in school, giving richer students the benefit of extra time, which they can then use to learn from expensive private tutors.
Language is another considerable barrier for prospective students. A large group of test takers don't come from predominantly English-speaking households, schools, or countries. This is especially true for international students, many of whom suffer on the English segment of the SAT but do considerably better in the Maths section. Even though acing the math section helps immensely, often, it is not quite enough to pull up their results near to a perfect score.
Graduates who stay back and wish to be recruited into civil service jobs may be more concerned about the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) examination. This test, taken in three distinct levels, matches successful candidates into 27 different sectors, including postal, law enforcement, and health services. Some jobs fall into the general cadre and do not require specific undergraduate degrees. Others fall into the technical/professional cadre and have specific undergraduate requirements. Although the second and third levels are somewhat to completely specialised, the first test is fully standardised. Since most of the candidates are eliminated in the first round, the content of the test is a little concerning.
Everyone sitting for the first stage of the BCS exam takes the very same test, regardless of their cadre of choice. So, a prospective administration officer (general) essentially answers the same questions as a health professional (professional). The questions test the candidate's basic skills in 10 different areas (language, national and international affairs, geography, ethics, etc) and while they are essential, they don't do much in evaluating the candidate's proficiency at their future job. Instead, that proficiency test is reserved for the second test, where only candidates who applied to the professional cadre answer education/job-related questions worth 200 marks out of a 900-mark written test.
When candidates are tested on basic knowledge first and professional skills second, examiners risk losing candidates who may have otherwise been better qualified for their jobs but not so adept at general knowledge. Don't get me wrong, basic skills are vital, but before we part ways, ask yourself this: would you choose to visit a good doctor who's terrible at geography or a relatively worse doctor who knows all the world capitals?

Today, we are here with Rubayyat Jahan and Raja Kaasheff. They have recently released some songs which have been greatly appreciated by the listeners and critics alike.
Raja Kaasheff and Rubayyat Jahan: Thank you for having us here today.
Rafi Hossain: I have seen your new songs receiving a lot of praise from many big names of the industry. Raja had also done the musical arrangements for Runa Apa's songs, which were also praised. I think this is a huge achievement for your career.
Raja Kaasheff: It is a huge honour for me to be able to have done this. I feel very blessed. I also have to thank you for giving the idea to work with such big names like Runa Laila.
Rafi Hossain: 'DutiChokh' and 'Srabone', among other songs were very well received among the audience. Can you talk about those songs?
Rubayyat Jahan: DutiChokh was written and composed by Hira Kanchan Hirok and the musical arrangements were done by Raja Kaasheff. Srabone is a very beautiful song. The lyrics are quite old and folksy. I could describe it as lyrics passed on from one generation to the next.
Rafi Hossain: Can you talk about your journey to becoming a musical duo?
Raja Kaasheff: When there is love and passion, the journey is always a good one. We got together because of our love for music. Now, being able to do the project with Runa Laila is a big achievement, making this journey even more fruitful. I have to thank Rubayyat since Bangla isn't my first language, but I'm trying to improve every day. I also had the opportunity to go to India to record Bangla songs. We also made a song in Bangladesh in Bangla and Hindi, along with the music video which was released under T-Series. The videos were immensely appreciated. This shows that there is so much talent in Bangladesh and these talents can gain worldwide recognition. I'm trying to work with such talented individuals.
Rubayyat Jahan: Bangladesh has many talented individuals who can reach the international standard. We should appreciate and encourage them.
Rafi Hossain: Are you doing any new project we should look forward to?
Rubayyat Jahan: We have worked on many duets which will be released soon. The pandemic has definitely made the process slower, but we are still working hard. The release is happening at a slower pace because not everyone's emotional state is normal right now.
Rafi Hossain: How did you join hands with Runa Laila in your project?
Raja Kaasheff: Musical legends like Runa Laila are not only a master of their art, but they alsoappreciate youngsters and newcomers. I wrote to her on Facebook that I have a song that I wouldlike her to sing. She asked for us to meet and we did. I also had a patriotic song which I wanted torelease. She was given a formal invitation to the British Parliament to honour her for her fiftiethyears in the music industry. There, she launched our Hindi and patriotic Bangla song. Then, I told herthat I want to launch another patriotic song which she also loved.
Rafi Hossain: Were you ever expecting her to agree to your proposal and end up here?
Raja Kaasheff: I never imagined this would happen, and I am incredibly grateful. I am so thankfulthat she appreciated my work. Appreciation encourages an artist to work hard. Runa Laila did thatfor me. She launched our album at the Commons and let me compose for her. She paved a path for us in Bangladesh.
Rafi Hossain: Can you talk about your experience with Asha Bhosle, Hariharan, Rahat Fateh Ali Khanand Adnan Sami?
Raja Kaasheff: It was an incredible experience with music and the respect great artists have for eachother. That's what I want to exist between all artists, regardless of age or experience. Another thingabout them is that they are willing to sing over and over again until they get the perfect take.Hearing all of these artists sing in Bangla was breathtaking. I think this project will be rememberedby generations to come.
Rubayyat Jahan: I feel very fortunate that we could work with Runa Laila. She is a national treasure.We were able to learn a lot from her.
Rafi Hossain: Songs that have stood the test of time are of the melodious kind. I think Raja has thatold-school melodious aura in him.
Raja Kaasheff: I feel very honoured when someone says that I have that old flavour in my music.Some artists are unable to do that now because they do everything themselves. I believe that youneed many heads working together to get the perfect sound. While making the songs with RunaLaila and Adnan Sami, we had a very interactive and communicative process. When there is a groupof people being working for a song, it always turns out better than a one-man project.
Rafi Hossain: I think that a song will remain evergreen if it manages to touch the hearts of people.Do you agree?
Raja Kaasheff: Any song from any genre is good if it has a good melody and beat, be it old-school ornot.
Rafi Hossain: How do you think the new generation is taking Bangla songs?
Rubayyat Jahan: The new generation has a slightly different taste. Some may not be skilled in thelanguage, but they still appreciate the music. We tend to put a mix of English and Hindi in our songs,or even when we are singling in full Bangla, we try to deliver it in an interesting way so that theyenjoy it. I think that the delivery is very important. It is our duty to compose good music and lyrics sothat the new generation accepts our songs.
Raja Kaasheff: The musical legends would learn certain techniques from classical singers and makesongs from those. They would give the audience a fusion of the raw organic tunes with their ownflavour. It's all about the presentation of both language and music.
Rafi Hossain: Thank you for being here today. I hope you work with many great artists and takeBangla songs to new heights."

","England captain Joe Root has said he ""would love"" to play in Pakistan but is unsure when the space could be found in a crowded schedule ahead of a planned tour in 2022.  
England have not played in Pakistan since 2005/06. An attack by armed militants on Sri Lanka's team bus in Lahore in 2009 ended major cricket tours for a decade, with Pakistan playing the majority of their subsequent 'home' matches in the United Arab Emirates.
But Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, West Indies and Bangladesh have all since made the trip to Pakistan.
Pakistan are 1-0 down in a three-Test series in England after a weather-affected drawn second Test at Southampton on Monday followed a three-wicket loss at Old Trafford earlier this month. 
""I'd love to go and visit Pakistan,"" Root told reporters after stumps at the Ageas Bowl in an echo of recent comments made by England coach Chris Silverwood.
""It would be a great opportunity to go and play there personally. Unfortunately, it's not my decision to make but it looks a wonderful country to go and play cricket in. 
""The wickets look nice and flat, which will be a nice change to what we have just played on here,"" the top-order batsman added.
'Emotion'
Test cricket returned to Pakistan in December, when Sri Lanka were the visitors.
""You see could see the emotion of everyone back in Pakistan when Test cricket was there at the back end of last year,"" said Root. 
""Also, speaking to a few of the players, how much it meant to them as well and they really appreciated being able to play back in Pakistan too.""
Earlier this month, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive Wasim Khan, voiced the hope that England could tour before 2022. 
""We'd love to have them coming over well before then for a shorter tour,"" said Khan, a Birmingham-born former batsman in English county cricket. ""It's something that we'll speak to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) about.""
But Root was wary about how additional fixtures could be added to an international programme still struggling with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
""We've such a busy schedule already with backlogging due to COVID, it will be interesting to see how that would work,"" he said. 
The current campaign, which sees the third Test, also at Southampton, start on Friday, follows last month's England-West Indies series that marked international cricket's return from lockdown.
Both the West Indies and Pakistan, among the poorer Test nations, have been praised for travelling to Britain, which has been hit hard by the COVID-19 outbreak, and helping spare the ECB an estimated £280 million ($366 million) loss if their scheduled matches were wiped out by the health crisis.
In order for the matches to proceed amid the virus, both sets of tourists have been restricted to onsite hotels at the Ageas Bowl and Manchester's Old Trafford in a bid to create a bio-secure bubble.
""You (England) boys owe Pakistan cricket, and the country, a lot, with the boys coming over here,"" Pakistan great Wasim Akram told Sky Sports on Sunday."

'Historic humiliation', cried the cover of Barcelona-based newspaper Sport, adding: 'A ridiculous Barca suffered its biggest defeat in Europe, ending a lamentable season without a trophy for the first time in 12 years.'
Daily Mundo Deportivo described the defeat on its cover as 'A shameful end to an era', also declaring that coach Quique Setien would be immediately sacked as coach and that president Josep Maria Bartomeu would call an election imminently.
National newspaper AS used the same headline as Sport, adding: 'The disaster against Barca opens up a crisis with far-reaching consequences at every level of the club.'
Marca used the word 'shame' on its cover, adding that Setien, who was hired in January to try and restore some style and flair to the team, had 'one foot and a half out of the door'.
Sport gave defender Nelson Semedo a rating of one out of 10 after he was tormented by Alphonso Davies in the build-up to the fifth goal scored by Joshua Kimmich. It gave Setien a rating of zero, adding: 'He cannot spend one more day in Barca's dugout.'
AS also said Setien's days at the club were numbered, adding that former Tottenham Hotspur coach Mauricio Pochettino was waiting in the wings, despite previously saying he would never coach Barca due to his loyalty to former club Espanyol."

Argentine striker Martinez, who scored twice, was the pinnacle of a perfect tactical display as Antonio Conte's team set up a clash with five-time champions Sevilla, also thanks to a goal by Danilo D'Ambrosio and a Romelu Lukaku brace.
Shakhtar had their share of possession but failed to threaten a compact Inter side, who eventually completely overwhelmed their opponents.
Sevilla beat Manchester United 2-1 on Sunday to book their place in Friday's showdown.
""It's an incredible night, the kind we dreamed of. It has been a long time since I had played such a match and we have shown that Inter are ready for the big matches,"" Martinez told Sky Sport Italia.
""I am very happy for the team, which is playing well and growing match after match.""
Shakhtar dominated possession as expected but were toothless up front and Inter opened the scoring with their first chance after 19 minutes.
Nicolo Barella collected a woeful clearance from goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov and raced down the right flank before crossing for Martinez, whose perfectly-timed header went into the back of the net.
Seeking their first trophy since a 2011 Coppa Italia triumph, Inter controlled Shakhtar, who pinged the ball around without being able to bring it forward before the 43rd minute, when Marcos Antonio fired a shot just over the bar.
Pyatov made up for his earlier mistake with a superb save four minutes into the second half, tipping the ball wide to deny Martinez who had attempted a fine loop from 30 metres.
Shakhtar, who had not mustered a single shot on target in the first half, still failed to threaten after the break until the 62nd minute when Junior Morales headed the ball straight at Samir Handanovic.
""We've had a great campaign in Europe but this result was a big disappointment. We couldn't show our football. Their second goal destroyed us mentally,"" said Shakhtar's Davit Khocholava.
""Inter have two fantastic strikers. It was very hard to play against them in one-on-one situations.""
Inter were just more clinical.
Two minutes later, D'Ambrosio headed home from Barella's corner to make it 2-0.
REMARKABLE MARTINEZ
Martinez curled in a perfect shot in the 74th to cap a remarkable individual performance, dashing any hope of a comeback by Shakhtar.
Martinez, who before his brace had not previously scored in the competition, then turned provider releasing Lukaku on the right for the Belgian striker to make it 4-0 from inside the box.
Lukaku has now scored in 10 consecutive Europa League matches and by producing another cool finish at the end of powerful run seven minutes from time, he is now one short of Ronaldo's mark of 34 goals in one season for Inter in 1997-98.
""We are a team that is growing day by day, there are both young and experienced players. This is fundamental in a team, so the less experienced can follow those who have more experience,"" added Martinez.
""Sevilla are a strong team. We will try to prepare as best we can for this match, we hope that everything goes well and that the Cup can go to Inter."""

The newspaper got their way as Setien was sacked on Monday, the first casualty of the Bayern bloodbath. But the fact that the 61-year-old was ever handed the keys to the Camp Nou should be regarded as one of the club's biggest ever mistakes.
In a move that seemed to sum up the club's motto of 'More than a Club', last January Barca took the surprising decision to sack Ernesto Valverde, whose side were top of La Liga at the time and had swept to back-to-back Spanish titles.
Merely winning matches and trophies, the decision seemed to suggest, was no longer deemed good enough for a club that prides itself on producing top-class entertainment on the pitch.
But after being rejected by Xavi Hernandez and Ronald Koeman, Barca landed on Setien, who had never won a trophy and bizarrely remarked in his presentation that he got the call to coach Barca while strolling among cows in the countryside.
His previous biggest job was with Real Betis, where he presided over spectacular wins against the likes of Real Madrid, Barca and AC Milan but was ultimately sacked after a poor second season which saw him face mass protests from supporters.
An engaging and often idealistic coach, Setien was chosen due to his devotion to the coaching philosophy of Barca's iconic Johan Cruyff but he quickly proved to be hopelessly behind the times as the club's gamble badly backfired.
His side often served up soporific football that was slow and ponderous and frequently failed to win the games that mattered most, something Valverde usually managed, even if the football was not always exciting.
Setien's Barca lost to Valencia and Real Madrid while drawing with Atletico Madrid, Sevilla and Celta Vigo, the latter three results coming in the final stretch of the season as they meekly surrendered the title to Real.
They did manage one outstanding performance in a 4-1 win over Villarreal but that was very much the exception that proved the rule, and another disappointment was just around the corner as the team lost 2-1 at home to Osasuna.
The usually softly-spoken and shy Lionel Messi let rip after that game, appearing to blame Setien for the team's predicament as he declared: ""Ever since January it has been all bad.""
Messi finished his tirade by declaring Barca had no hope of winning the Champions League but surely not even he could have predicted his team would be beaten so brutally by Bayern.
But perhaps Setien's disastrous performance in the Champions League should have come as no surprise.
After all, he had never taken charge of a game in Europe's top competition before leaving the serene countryside and grazing cows for the bear pit that is the Barca job."

","Walking towards a school field -- more like a small open space at the front of a building -- on a gloomy day with the earth muddied by incessant rainfall, this reporter was awestruck to see a bunch of school girls practising football with razor sharp focus even in such a poorly facilitated environment.
And after standing there for a few minutes witnessing the prowess and the matured game sense portrayed by those budding footballers, it became almost certain that those young girls had a purpose in mind and playing football was much more than just a fun pastime on a rainy day.
Digging into the matter, it was learned that the 16 girls playing were from Goaldah Government Primary School, which is 20 kilometers away from Magura district. Of these 16, five are in BKSP while nine have already represented the country in different age-level tournaments.
The girls' perseverance and steely determination, playing on a small muddy ground nowhere near the standard of even a mediocre practice facility, was on display as they practiced with the level of enthusiasm resembling that of professionals in a properly appointed football ground at the highest level. And much of the credit for such eagerness goes to headmaster Provash Ranjan Devjyoti and his assistant teacher Shahidul Islam, who act as their coaches and guide them in their pursuit.  
While there is no shortcoming in their determination, lacking are their financial capabilities and a decent enough ground to help them grow. Take the case of Swarna Rani Mondol, an eighth-grader in the BKSP and an age-level goalkeeper. Those who witnessed Swarna saving two penalties in the tie-breaker to snatch victory for her team in the Bangamata Begum Fazilatunessa Mujib Gold Cup (under-17) last February at Bangabandhu Stadium, would probably not believe the hurdles Swarna had to overcome before becoming the shield for her team.   
""We very often pass our days without consuming any food. We remain unfed if my husband [a day labourer] cannot manage work. We cannot provide necessary things like books, pens and other sports materials and it also becomes very difficult to pay Tk 700 per month to BKSP as Swarna's fees,"" said Sarma Rani Mondol, Swarna's mother. 
Purnima Rani Mondol, a ninth-grader in BKSP who represented Bangladesh at the age-level in SAF Games in Kathmandu in 2019, also lives with similar financial constraints. No work, no food is the harshest reality for Purnima's family of four, headed by her father Nripen Chandra Mondol, also a day labourer.


Another BKSP ninth-grader and age-level player Ria Khatun is now faced with hanging up her boots at this nascent stage. Ria, who took part in Subrata Mukherjee Gold Cup tournament in New Delhi in 2018 and 2019 and scored a goal in the 2018 edition, has injured a ligament in her right leg while practising at the BKSP. As doctors suggested, Ria would soon be needing a Tk 1.5 lakh operation if she wants to go further in the game.
""I do not own a land of my own. I can barely make enough to feed the six of us [in his family] by working on others' land. It is impossible for me to arrange such a big amount [for Ria's treatment],"" said Ashaduzzaman, Ria's father.
Meanwhile, Anika Tanjum, the most talented of them all, is in better financial condition than the rest of the girls. Anika, as academically meritorious as she is skilful with a ball at her feet, has scored three crucial goals and led the Khulna Division (Under-17 side) to the Bangamata Begum Fazilatunessa Mujib Gold Cup title last February. The contribution of these girls has not gone unnoticed. Much like the promising girls of the famed Kalsindur village of Dhobaura upazila in Mymensingh, the Goaldah village also boasts a number of talented footballers and the Magura district sports officer acknowledged their contribution.
""These girls have given notable performances in the Under-14 and Under-17 level. I hope they will maintain the good reputation that they have built so far,"" hoped Anamika Das, district sports officer of Magura. 
And when the whole world is struggling to fight with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic with many athletes around the globe still uncertain about returning to the field, for the girls of a small village like Goaldah, playing football remains their only focus even in a not-so welcoming environment."

Setien, 61, was appointed in January after the club sacked two-time league winner Ernesto Valverde despite his side sitting top of the La Liga standings on goal difference.
But after Barca were condemned to their heaviest defeat in European competition on Friday, Setien was also sacked after only seven months in charge, after overseeing the club's first trophy-less season in 12 years.
Barca finished second in La Liga behind champions Real Madrid and were knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the quarter-final stage by Athletic Bilbao.
""This is the first decision within a wider restructuring of the first team which will be agreed between the current technical secretary and the new coach, who will be announced in the coming days,"" added Barca's statement on Setien.
According to widespread Spanish media reports, Netherlands coach and former Barca defender Ronald Koeman is set to be named as Setien's successor.
The statement, which was released more than nine hours after president Josep Maria Bartomeu and directors had begun a board meeting, also said the club's hierarchy had decided against calling an election imminently in the wake of the Bayern defeat, as many fans and influential voices had demanded.
""The board understand that an immediate call for elections is not feasible, given that the league season will begin on the weekend of September 12, 2020, and the situation arising from the COVID-19 crisis - both economically and socially,"" added the statement.
""Consequently, the club will continue to implement the plan to reverse the sporting and economic situation, based on profound changes to the first team, plus a redefined budget to deal with the new situation caused by COVID-19, before the end of the current mandate.""
As at Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Barcelona presidents are voted for by club members.
Bartomeu won the last election, held in 2015, but is barred from running in the next round of elections as he has already served two consecutive mandates, having been named president in 2014 after the resignation of Sandro Rosell.
Victor Font is the front-runner for the election, while former president Joan Laporta has also declared his intention to run."

","World motorcycling superstar Valentino Rossi said a rival's stray bike, travelling at around 300 km/h (187mph), almost ""killed me"" in a horrifying near-miss at the Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday.
The 41-year-old Italian, a nine-time world champion, was left badly shaken after Franco Morbidelli's Yamaha flew across the track just centimetres in front of him.
Morbidelli and the Ducati of Johann Zarco had collided just seconds before the riders slipped through turn four at Spielberg on lap eight of the race. Both men were unseated.
Zarco's free-wheeling Ducati also came desperately close to hitting Rossi as well as his Yamaha factory teammate Maverick Vinales who was just ahead of him.
""Morbidelli's bike nearly killed me,"" fumed Rossi. ""Even Zarco's Ducati passed a few metres over me, it was a very dangerous moment.""
Incredibly, Rossi managed to compose himself and after the race was restarted came home in fifth place. 
""I was so scared. I am shaken, resuming the race was tough. I took the biggest risk of my career,"" Rossi told Sky Italia.
""I saw a shadow, I thought it was the helicopter from above, sometimes it happens during the race that the helicopter passes over and casts a shadow. Instead, two 'bullets' arrived.
""The saint of motorcyclists today did a really great job, it was a very dangerous thing.""
Morbidelli, possibly a teammate of Rossi's next season at the Yamaha satellite team, did not mince his words.
'Like a murderer'
""Zarco is almost a murderer,"" Morbidelli told Sky Sport Italia. 
""Braking like this at 300 km/h means having little love for yourself or for those you are racing against.
""I hope this major incident makes Zarco think. It was really dangerous for me, him, for Rossi and Vinales who were up front and saw a bike coming at them at 280 per hour."""

","23 years and three avatars later, the Star Weekend magazine arrives upon its last ever edition. Being your Friday companion has been an education in hard work and creativity. As we face the curtain call, we offer to you one last critical look at something we care passionately about, and offer in the process an explanation as to what catalysed the last chapter of Star Weekend. This week, as we end, we talk about the future of journalism.
 
Eight years ago, I saw a small ad in the Friday magazine of The Daily Star which changed the course of my life—for better or worse. The Star, it said, was looking for a feature writer. I had never imagined myself as a writer, much less a journalist, but I was overtaken that day by a curious desire to apply for a position. I thus penned an elaborate application, justifying why the magazine was the best fit for a young anthropologist interested in making sense of and telling stories about the world. I remember writing, with great conviction, how only in the magazine one could be a storyteller, a journalist and anthropologist all at once.
Eight years of being an ‘accidental’ journalist later, I can say with certainty that I stayed in this profession because of those early days at the magazine and what it taught me about what journalism could be. It was why I took up the position of editor at Star Weekend years later, after the magazine had been reduced to a tabloid, a shadow of its former self. It is why I write, even at this penultimate hour of the final final issue of the Friday magazine (as we know it), there is hope for journalism still.  
Journalism, at its best, is a way of seeing, interpreting and interrogating the complex world that we inhabit. Yet, so often, print journalism in this country is reduced to a 500-word ‘breaking’ story with no ‘before’ and ‘after’, as if an event exists in a vacuum and can be made sense of without context, without multiplicity of voices and without any acknowledgement of our own implication in the story. At Star Weekend, we warned ourselves against such simplification—reality was nuanced, and the stories we told had to be as well.
And we weren’t interested in the kind of apolitical storytelling that is fashionable in certain elite circles in Dhaka these days—we believed in having a point of view, a pro-people, pro-worker, pro-women, pro-minorities, pro-environment, pro-democracy, pro-freedom point of view. We tried to constantly interrogate our own privileges, operating as we did within an elite English newspaper, and made conscious efforts to address our class bias in the kind of stories we did and how we did them. We tried to be ethical in our representations—of survivors of violence, of sexual and ethnic minorities, of the people who trusted us to tell their stories—and reflexive about the role of the media in perpetuating harmful stereotypes and hierarchies. We spent many a Tuesday afternoon debating the politics of an image or the usage of a vernacular—we wanted to be deliberate as well as responsible in our choices. If we faltered, as we must have, we ask today for your forgiveness.   
We were luckier perhaps than our colleagues in the newsroom who are so caught up in the aggressive cycle of breaking news and day to day events in an increasingly chaotic socio-political climate that they could easily begrudge us for the week we got to spend pursuing and honing a story. We were luckier too than our colleagues in the editorial section who have the difficult job of saying what needs to be said without actually saying it in so many words. In many ways, it was our distance from the newsroom that gave us more freedom to experiment, push the boundaries of censorship and curate a platform in which critical and politically conscious public opinion was a driving force. We weren’t always successful—constrained as we were by a lack of resources, increasing commodification of the media and intolerant state and non-state machineries—but, hey, at least we tried.
We had to deal with our fair share of criticism as well. Our issues, we were told, were not glamorous enough to attract advertisers. We wore it as a badge of honour. Among other things, it meant we had the freedom to fill up our issues with what we thought was worth informing the public about, instead of nice, glossy photos of products masked as content. Despite repeated requests, we politely (and at times not so politely) refused to succumb to PR requests. As we count down to the end, at least we can say we remained true to our ideals… and what’s so unglamorous about that?
Yet others said: no one wants to read sad things on a weekend. We did have more than our share of “sad” stories. It was, in fact, a running joke in our department—give us a happy story and we’ll make sure to find the saddest, goriest or most illegal angle in it. Then again, what could we do if the world we inhabited was a cruel one, one in which three-year-olds are raped by their uncles, stone crushers slowly die of silicosis, workers are systematically robbed of their dues and mangrove forests are sacrificed for illogical greed? We tried to balance the inevitable sadness of life under late capitalism with a dash of humour and satire, a splash of travel, and a generous serving of literary and art criticism, book reviews and cultural analysis. But we didn’t believe in the kind of feel-good journalism that has become the trend these days, especially in supplements and magazines, which provide a welcoming slate for guilt-free consumption. We wrote about the world we saw and wanted to change—we were interested in interrogating taken-for-granted structures of power, bringing to public memory what would otherwise be lost, and exploring our own complicities in sustaining the status quo. We knew our stories could never compete with Shakib Khan’s big personal family reveal, cricket hero Shakib Al Hasan’s holiday escapade or Kate Middleton’s green shalwar kameez—they needed to be told, nonetheless.
The world is changing fast, and journalism, in this country and worldwide, is struggling to catch up. In a bid to stay afloat and relevant, media houses around the world are being forced to downsize—many esteemed outlets have had to close down their print editions, many have gone out of business altogether. Even well-known and respected newspapers such The Guardian, which has an estimated 38 million unique visitors per day compared to a print circulation of just 200,000 copies, haven’t yet figured out how to make up for lost print revenues without compromising their journalistic ethics. In our part of the world, print still remains—and will remain for some time more—the staple, but newspapers are already struggling to hold on to ad revenues, failing to garner adequate revenues through its digital editions, and losing a big chunk of its advertisers to digital platforms such as Facebook. Some are beginning to downsize—The Daily Star itself is having to reduce the number of pages in print and slash its supplements in half, a move that has left many of us who started our careers in print, anxious about the future.
The newsroom is having to adapt, too. Gone are the days of 24-hour news cycles—in order to remain relevant, it now has to deliver on the hour while still curating original content for print the next day. Not only must it now compete with the numerous TV news channels airing events as they unfold in real time, but also with a proliferation of unprofessional digital platforms who simply copy-paste breaking news from mainstream sites and run sensationalised click-baits, even fake news, to boost their page views. As established media houses navigate increasingly stringent digital laws and state surveillance, such digital platforms can get away without even the most basic of verification processes.
Under the circumstances, newsrooms have no choice but to evolve. Yet the harsh truth is, evolution requires investment—investment in human resources, newer technologies and innovative ideas. It involves taking risks and experimenting with forms and platforms in ways we had never envisioned before. But as is often the case, when one is struggling to stay competitive, cost-cutting, not investment, becomes the mantra of the day. It’s a classic chicken-and-egg situation: do you survive first so you can invest later, or do you invest now so you can survive later? The route each media house takes from hereon will determine its future course.
As for Star Weekend, and why it’s closing down, there’s no simple answer. On our end, it was no longer possible to do the kind of in-depth journalism that we wanted to do within the constraints of what was forced to become an eight-page print publication (a significant portion of which was expected to be filled with advertisements to make it financially feasible). With an understaffed and resource-starved team, we too were getting frustrated about always being on the sidelines when we were doing investigative stories and in-depth analysis that we felt needed sustained funding and space within the “mainframe”. It’s not just newsrooms, but news, too, which must evolve, as consumer tastes change and become more sophisticated and global. Unlike what we initially feared (and what many still mistakenly believe), younger audiences do actually care about the news, even if they no longer want to consume it in the same form that traditional news outlets in Bangladesh have been delivering it. If we are to compete, we can no longer simply to do a 500-word story that is already yesterday’s evening news written in terse and tired language. We must provide investigative stories, incisive analysis, infographics, data stories, and innovative platforms to engage audiences. But beyond, readers increasingly want specialised content that reflect their choices and aspirations—and that includes reviews, art features, longforms, literary non-fiction, travel stories and more. It’s time for the news, in other words, to reflect more of the magazine.
This last ever issue of Star Weekend explores some of these key developments and concerns about where the industry is and where it is headed. It brings attention to layoffs in the media over the past year and contextualises them within a changing landscape. Leading editors, academics and columnists share their aspirations and frustrations about journalism as it is practiced today, under increasingly authoritarian regimes, rampant commercialisation of news, and unsustainable revenue models in the new digital era. Young readers tell us what they actually want to read—and *breaking news* it’s not true that they don’t have the attention span to read a longform article. We hope this issue provides a context, if not closure, to why we must bid you a tearful farewell.
I am filled with an indescribable grief at the thought that this team will cease to function as one, although I hope that we’ll continue to collaborate across departments and platforms as had been our dream at Star Weekend. To my team, I have too much to say and not enough space (or emotional strength) to say it: you’ve been my inspiration. You’ve been brave and tenacious, you’ve proved, time and time again, your commitments to journalism and to the public to whom we are accountable. I’ll miss the weekly meetings that never quite happened, the inevitable struggle to convince Pathao food to deliver to our office, scolding y’all for your late-ass submissions, that one glorious week of steaming coffee before we broke the coffeemachine, late-night forays into the forbidden chaad, gaggling into the evening and forgetting we had a deadline to meet, movie screenings of Mamma Mia and Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, the joy when something we thought would be censored passed the “will-we-get-arrested” test and the satisfaction of putting to bed a satisfactory issue—before midnight. I’ll miss each of your quirks and your incredible abilities—Abida, Apurbo, Chandan, Maliha, Nilima, Sarah, Zyma, and honorary staff Shaer. To those who left us, Elin, Amiya, Fayeka and Manan da, we wish you were here on this last Tuesday but at least you were spared the end. To Deb da, Emdud bhai, and Shamim bhai, thanks for burning the midnight oil with us. Aasha apa, you’ve been the fairy godmother when we wanted chocolates and hugs, and the Sicilian godfather when we needed strength and strategising. To Mahfuz bhai, thank you for allowing us to barge into your room at all hours of the day with our stories and ideas, and finally for trusting me with Star Weekend. For that, I will always be indebted.   
To all those academics and activists we bugged in the middle of the workday (and at times frantically called up on Monday or Tuesday nights!) for articles, advice, and quotes, thank you for your insights, contributions, and encouragements. It’s your strength and dedication that inspired us to keep on going when we were tired and frustrated with censorship and the general state of affairs of the country. To all those writers who made us laugh, who made us think and reflect, who made us nostalgic, who made us travel to South America and back, who made us want to pick up a long-forgotten book from a dusty shelf, who made us debate the political potential of a film by Warner Bros, we say, thank you. Thank you for making the Weekend chill out, while also engaging us in productive dialogues in the process.
To our successors, the Toggle team, we leave our valued readers in your tech-savvy hands. As the Friday magazine evolves to its next avatar, a tech lifestyle magazine, we look forward to what the future holds for our weekend(s).
It was fun—while it lasted.

It has been like that for a while now – but it is August now. Much like my calendar, the world has come to a pause. The global pandemic has brought our lives to a standstill. It all started with a distant whisper of a foreign disease that had been wiping out lives on the other side of the globe. But here's the thing about people - unless it affects them, they don't realise the magnitude of the situation.
Soon, bad news took the form of bulletins and headlines; they took the form of runaway COVID patients, appearing in the hospital my mother works at. As both of my parents are anesthesia specialists, we knew the risks that came with being frontline workers during this pandemic.
Every war needs its warriors, and this time, it was them. Nobly, they fulfill their duty to the country, their duty to the people. But that doesn't make things any easier. ""Frontline fighters, heroes,"" people call them. "" Also humans,"" I retort angrily. I wonder what is this anger is for - this disease? The world? Or the fact that my hands lack the power to do anything about it all? Maybe all of them.
My sister and I don't greet our parents when they return home, donned in their white gear. We don't see them until they take baths, scrub themselves clean and wash their clothes. They leave early in the morning the next day. Rinse and repeat – a daily ritual.
Adapting takes the form of inside jokes and chores like cooking and cleaning. It takes the form of listening about patients and doctors every day - of those who survived and those who didn't. The news and statistics can only provide numbers but our dinner table conversations etched faces and names to them. Soon, our parents complained of throat ache. We all sighed in relief when they tested negative.  
That doesn't mean that we're always good at adapting though. The constant stress takes the form of frequent arguments and lashing out from pent up frustration. It becomes apparent in my father's lack of appetite that working in an ICU unit takes a toll on him. We hide the worry behind humour, and even worse, apathy. Days go on in a blur and I no longer sleep at night.
While our daily lives have become confined to our homes, we've become more connected in the cyber space than ever before. This socially distanced period has led to a surge of creativity for many. Scrolling down my news feed I see young people, exploring their talents and their hobbies, from painting and drawing to singing and dancing, behind their closed doors. Some are experimenting with their culinary skills, while others are dabbling in crafts. Some are opting for a more academic approach, taking up courses to equip their arsenal. Then, there are those who are working for the greater good – raising funds to combat the pandemic and the floods and preparing meals for humans and animals alike. From the humanitarian work to the boom in creativity, in these perilous times, these are truly some magical stories to experience.    
Then, there are those who can't adjust to this new lifestyle. Some are having a hard time getting up from bed - and that's okay. Some can't gain access to the online classes and are feeling as if the world has left them behind. All of their anguish is valid, as we are living in a global pandemic.
I myself haven't been the most productive at home. I marvel at the work of our youth, at their passion and at their drive. So, I write about those who sacrifice for the people and about those who are fighting their inner battles. I write about hope and despair, a chance for a better tomorrow. It's natural to be upset, to miss the hangouts and the companionships. There shouldn't be any pressure to be productive. We all are waging our own battles, and every small victory counts.
It is okay to take small steps - writing a small to do list, cooking a rare dish, watching that series you have always wanted to start, singing off-tune – it is okay to just stay alive. There's a desk calendar on my wardrobe. I finally flipped the pages. It's August and my clock has resumed ticking again. I'm here and we're alive. That is enough, for now."

""It's basically the only game I play,"" said Erricker, an 11-year-old in Bengaluru, India, an avid Fortnite player on his Apple iPad. ""I'm not happy, I don't think it's a good move.""
Fortnite, which has attracted more than 350 million players globally, is especially popular among younger gamers and has become one of the few lifelines to the outside world for kids trapped at home during the coronavirus pandemic. Unable to play outside, kids are spending hours with friends chit-chatting and fighting on Fortnite, which is free to play and available on nearly all devices.
Apple and Alphabet Inc's Google on Thursday removed Fornite from their app stores for violating in-app payment guidelines, and the news spread rapidly among kids who are otherwise too young to get headlines off CNN, the BBC or the New York Times.
Removal means no new players can download the game and the app will not receive updates from the store. But the game will continue to work for now for those who already have it.
Calum Jack, an eight-year-old from London, heard the Fortnite news from friends in Asia as soon as he woke up at 6 a.m. The topic was ""all over YouTube,"" he said.
He is online up to 10 hours a day, playing, building or just chatting with up to 20 friends as far apart as Canada and India. Fortnite and other online games have been Jack's main social outlet since coronavirus lockdowns closed schools across the world in March.
""It's been very important since we've been on holiday. We play all the time,"" he said.
Fortnite-owner Epic Games has challenged Apple's policy of taking a cut of purchases made inside the app by allowing users to pay Epic directly at a cheaper price. The financial ramifications of the move were apparent even to young gamers.
""Epic was cutting into Apple's profit margins,"" said Zoraan Kunnel, 13, of Bengaluru, India.
On Thursday, Epic released a video within Fortnite, on YouTube and other social media channels mocking Apple's iconic ""1984"" ad with the hashtag ""FreeFortnite."" The hashtag has trended on social media and racked up nearly 26 million views on short-form video app TikTok.
""My friends think that Fortnite is going to win the argument,"" Erricker said. ""There's a lot of people who play Fortnite, and they'll be against Apple.""
As to what Jack will do if the game stops working on his iPad, he said: ""I'd just play on the PS4."""

Games that are easy the access, free to play. Games like Valorant, PUBG mobile get plagued by these problems most. This is because of their business models. These games are designed to be accessed easily by most people. In doing so, many security measures are compromised. If they want to restrict the accessibility, they cannot do without their business model taking a hit.
What kind of cheats are used?
Well, in a shooting game, knowing the enemy's position is a huge advantage. So, many of the cheats are meant to reveal the enemy's location. Wall hack, ESP hack, X-ray vision hacks. There are some cheats that compensate for the player's lack of skills. Aimbot, auto headshot, increased damage are some cheats used by many.
Is there any way to counter this problem?
There is always an option for reporting the player. The cheater may get banned. But it is of little help considering these are easily accessible games. Meaning, the cheaters can play it from another account without facing difficulty. In fact, Riot Games boasted about their anti-cheat mechanics in Valorant which would stop a player from entering matches if any cheat was detected. It did not work out that well. They have released multiple patches, but the situation has not improved much. The developers have addressed these issues and said that they are working on a solution. The players can only hope for a quick solution and wait."

However there are still people out there who tend to lean towards offline games (including yours truly).","2019 is almost over and let’s be honest, online gaming is THE thing now.  However there are still people out there who tend to lean towards offline games (including yours truly).
So I recently decided to give online games a shot after incessant suggestions from my brother to try them out. Consequently over the past few days, I tried it out, and played some of the most popular formats of online gaming, namely co-ops, battle royales and online FPS. And so these are the following reasons as to why one should consider making the shift from offline to online games.
One of the biggest selling points of offline games is the fact that they give you the opportunity to immerse yourself in a story. But it comes at the cost of you having to play with the console AI. And at times it gets boring, repetitive and offers fewer challenges. I’ve been in situations where I’ve been so familiar with the AI that I could predict its next move. This is where online multiplayer games come in. These are games where you’re almost always up against a human opponent. Now for games you’ve been playing for a long time, this will offer you new challenges. Also there are a lot of games out there that offer co-op missions e.g. Assassin’s Creed Unity. Trust me when I say this, nothing can be more fun than doing a mission with a story driven objective with you and your friend covering for each other.
Most online multiplayer games come with very big tradeoffs. On one hand, offline games usually have an immersive story blended with the gameplay so these can be amazing experiences when done right. However, with the exception of a few amazing games it gets boring and repetitive owing to the fact that you are playing against an AI and the game might not have anything interesting to offer before you’re even done with the game. This is where online multiplayer games come in. Typically online multiplayer games also have a reward system. I’ve personally played DOTA 2—you get to play your way up the ranks, unlock new skins and items. Even though you have to sacrifice the story and the immersive aspect of it, it comes with human rivals and allies and actual rankings giving you the scope to judge who’s better, which ultimately makes the game more competitive and interesting.
That being said, online games come with more perks like getting gamer bros. I honestly lost count of the number of times I just sat there in the chat room talking to my fellow gamers and passing hours. You get to know new people all the while getting to socialise with your old friends. These points might not be valid for everyone. However in the short span of time for which I’ve tried online gaming, I felt that if I were to shift over to online gaming, it would definitely be for these reasons. That being said, I also feel that every offline gamer should try online multiplayers out. They definitely have more to offer than what we think of them at first."
www.thedailystar.net/toggle/news/epic-games-sues-apple-over-removal-fortnite-1944865,TOGGLE,2020-08-14T02:34:11+06:00,2020-08-14T02:34:11+06:00,"Fortnite maker sues Apple, Google after removal of game from app stores","Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google on Thursday removed popular video game ""Fortnite"" from their app stores for violating the in-app payment guidelines, prompting developer Epic Games to file federal antitrust lawsuits challenging their rules.","Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google on Thursday removed popular video game ""Fortnite"" from their app stores for violating the in-app payment guidelines, prompting developer Epic Games to file federal antitrust lawsuits challenging their rules.
Apple and Google cited a direct payment feature rolled out on the Fortnite app earlier in the day as the violation.
Epic sued in U.S. court seeking no money from Apple or Google, but rather injunctions that would end many of the companies' practices related to their app stores.
""Apple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation. Apple is bigger, more powerful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than the monopolists of yesteryear,"" Epic said in its lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California.
Epic also attacked Apple on social media, launching a campaign with the hashtag #FreeFortnite, urging players to seek refunds from Apple if they lose access to the game, and creating a parody of Apple's famous ""1984"" television ad.
In the parody, which quickly garnered hundreds of thousands of views, a female Fortnite fighter hurls a unicorn-shaped club to smash a screen on which an Apple-headed character speaks of ""the anniversary of the platform unification directives.""
Apple takes a cut of between 15% and 30% for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps, though there are some exceptions for companies that already have a credit card on file for iPhone customers if they also offer an in-app payment that would benefit Apple.
Analysts believe games are the biggest contributor to spending inside the App Store, which is, in turn, the largest component of Apple's $46.3 billion-per-year services segment.
In a statement, Apple said Fortnite was removed because Epic had launched the payment feature with the ""express intent of violating the App Store guidelines"" after having had apps in the store for a decade.
""The fact that their (Epic) business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users,"" Apple said.
Google also removed ""Fortnite"" from its Play Store, but the company's spokesman Dan Jackson declined to comment on the lawsuit when contacted by Reuters.
""However, we welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring Fortnite back to Google Play,"" he said in a statement. Jackson said Epic violated a rule requiring developers to use Google's in-app billing system for products within video games.
Apple and Google were among the major American technology companies to come under anti-competition scrutiny in a hearing before lawmakers last month.
During the hearing, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook argued that Apple is not anti-competitive because it does not have a majority share in any markets where it operates, including mobile phones, where devices powered by Alphabet Inc's Android have greater market share.
Epic's lawsuit, however, argued that app distribution and in-app payments for Apple devices constitute their own distinct market for anti-competition purposes because Apple users rarely leave its ""sticky"" ecosystem.
Epic's free-to-play battle-royal videogame ""Fortnite"" has reached massive popularity among young gamers since its launch in 2017, and competes with Tencent Holdings' ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"".
The title's removal from the App Store means that new players will not be able to download it and that existing players cannot receive updates, but the game should continue to work on devices where it is already installed.
Epic Games does not disclose how many iOS users ""Fortnite"" has. Many fans play the game primarily on PCs or gaming consoles while using their mobile phones as a backup, but iPhone users generate far more revenue for Epic.
In both Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store, ""Fortnite"" had about 2 million downloads in July 2020, according to mobile analytics firm SensorTower. But Apple users spent about $34 million while Android users spent only $2 million, according to SensorTower data.
Because Android functions differently from iOS, users can still download ""Fortnite"" from Epic's website and other non-Google stores such as the one run by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and install it on their devices, Epic said in a blog post on Thursday.
""Epic is not seeking any monetary relief, but rather only an order enjoining Google from continuing to impose its anti-competitive conduct on the Android ecosystem,"" it said in its lawsuit.
In a statement, Spotify Technology SA, a streaming music rival to Apple that has filed an antitrust complaint against the iPhone maker in Europe, applauded Epic's move.
""Apple's unfair practices have disadvantaged competitors and deprived consumers for far too long,"" Spotify said."

In an impassioned speech capping the first night of the Democratic National Convention, Obama said the Republican Trump ""has had enough time to prove that he can do the job"" but had failed to meet the moment in a country reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, economic turmoil and racial injustice.
""Whenever we look to this White House for some leadership or consolation or any semblance of steadiness, what we get instead is chaos, division, and a total and utter lack of empathy,"" she said, calling him ""the wrong president"" for the United States.
""He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is,"" Obama said. ""If you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me, they can; and they will if we don't make a change in this election. If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.""
Obama, whose husband, Barack Obama, was in the White House when Biden was vice president from 2009-2017, capped a long parade of speakers, including some of Trump's fellow Republicans, who gathered online to make the case for Biden at the start of his four-day nominating convention.
The harsh takedown by Michelle Obama, regularly cited in polls as one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party, could generate the sort of voter enthusiasm some Democrats thought a virtual convention might lack.
The convention opened amid widespread worries about the safety of voting in November because of the pandemic. Democrats have pushed voting by mail as a safe alternative, but Trump without evidence has proclaimed it is prone to fraud and blocked emergency aid for the US Postal Service to limit mail-in voting.
Obama referred to these concerns, saying those who could not win a fair election were trying to stop people from voting by closing polling places in minority neighborhoods, purging voter rolls and lying about the security of mail-in ballots.
""We have to vote for Joe Biden in numbers that cannot be ignored,"" she said. ""We have got to grab our comfortable shoes, put on our masks, pack a brown bag dinner and maybe breakfast too, because we've got to be willing to stand in line all night if we have to.""
Showcasing the broad spectrum of supporters united against defeating Trump, former Democratic presidential candidate and progressive Senator Bernie Sanders and prominent Republican John Kasich joined in with Obama.
""Joe Biden will end the hate and division Trump has created. He will stop the demonization of immigrants, the coddling of white nationalists, the racist dog whistling, the religious bigotry and the ugly attacks on women,"" Sanders said.
The pandemic forced Democrats to overhaul the convention, largely eliminating the in-person gathering planned for Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and turning it into two-hour, prime-time packages of virtual speeches and events from around the country.
It featured discussions with voters who described their struggles confronting the virus and coping with the slumping economy and healthcare.
Kristin Urquiza, who lost her father to Covid-19, blamed Trump's mismanagement of the pandemic for his death.
""My dad was a healthy 65-year-old. His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that, he paid with his life,"" she said. ""When I cast my vote for Joe Biden, I will do it for my Dad.""
In a break with tradition by which candidates limit their activities during their opponents' conventions, Trump campaigned cross-country.
He posted more than two dozen tweets and retweets after the convention program, primarily targeting New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a critic of Trump's handling of the coronavirus. Trump steered clear of mentioning the popular former first lady.
The convention also highlighted a call for a broad reckoning over systemic racism and police brutality amid protests that broke out after the death of African American George Floyd in Minnesota under the knee of a white policeman.
Speaking from Houston, Floyd's brother Philonise Floyd introduced a moment of silence and honored other Black victims of police violence.
""So, it's up to us to carry on the fight for justice. Our actions will be their legacies,"" Floyd said.
Jim Clyburn, the influential US representative from South Carolina whose endorsement of Biden was critical to his breakthrough primary victory in that state in February, said Biden understood the need to unify people was part of presidential leadership.
Kasich, a former Ohio governor and frequent Trump critic who lost to Trump in the 2016 Republican primary, described his opposition to Trump as a patriotic duty and said the country was at a crossroads.
Standing literally at a fork in a road, he called Biden ""a man who can help us see the humanity in each other.""
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said Kasich ""was a loser as a Republican and he'll be a loser as a Democrat.""
Other Republicans on the speakers list included former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman and former Hewlett Packard Enterprise Chief Executive Meg Whitman.
""Donald Trump has no clue how to run a business, let alone an economy,"" Meg Whitman said.
The inclusion of Republican speakers angered some Democrats who voiced concern it would take time away from progressive speakers like Sanders of Vermont and US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
But Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and Biden campaign co-chair, pushed back against that idea, telling reporters earlier in the day, ""Remember tonight's theme is 'We the People,' not 'We the Democrats.'""
Biden, 77, leads Trump, 74, in national opinion polls heading into back-to-back convention weeks for the two political parties. Trump will be formally nominated for a second term at next week's Republican National Convention, which also has been scaled back due to coronavirus concerns."

Judge Md Rabiul Alam of Third Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court of Dhaka passed the order, Advocate Salauddin Howlader, assistant public prosecutor of the concerned court, told The Daily Star.
The accused are Nazneen Ferdous, former acting principal of the school, and Zinat Akhtar, former morning shift in-charge of the school.
The court also issued arrest warrants against the duo.
Meanwhile, Beauty Adhikary, Aritry's mother, gave her statement before the court during today's hearing while the court fixed September 23 for the next hearing.
Aritry was found hanging from the ceiling of her home in Shantinagar on December 3, 2018, hours after she and her parents were allegedly insulted by some teachers of the school.
The next day, her father Dilip Adhikary filed the case with Paltan Police Station, accusing three teachers of provoking Aritry to commit suicide.
Nazneen and Zinat were also suspended, following an education ministry order. They later got bail after surrendering before a Dhaka court.
Earlier, on March 28 last year, Detective Branch (DB) of police submitted charge sheet to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court of Dhaka against Nazneen Ferdous and Zinat Akhtar.
On July 10 last year, the court framed charges against the two accused."

","Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today repeated her allegations that BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia was involved in the August 21, 2004 grenade attack as her husband Ziaur Rahman was behind the August 15, 1975 killings.
""Ziaur Rahman was involved in the killings of the Father of the Nation, four national leaders…he killed army personnel through coups one after another. Khaleda Zia just did the same thing after coming to power,"" she said.
The prime minister said this as she joined a discussion virtually from her official residence Gono Bhaban.
Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Birth Centenary Celebration National Implementation Committee organised the programme at the International Mother Language Institute, marking the 45th martyrdom of the Father of the Nation and National Mourning Day.
The PM said Ziaur Rahman had made collaborators like Abdul Alim, Maulana Mannan and Shah Aziz ministers, prime minister and advisers.
Following Zia's footsteps, Hasina said, Khaleda Zia also made Nizami, Mujaheed and other culprits -- involved in the intellectuals' killings -- ministers.
The prime minister mentioned that Khaleda Zia made killer Rashid and Huda members of parliament.
""They (Zia and Khaleda) always patronised those who were involved in terrorism and killing,"" she said.
Regarding the involvement of Ziaur Rahman in the Bangabandhu killing, she said killers Faruq and Rashid in their statement had said that Ziaur Rahman was with them always and being empowered by these killers, he later proclaimed himself as the president of the country.
Sheikh Hasina said by selecting Ziaur Rahman as the army chief, Khandaker Mustaque had proved that they were together in the conspiracy.
About the August 21 grenade attack, she said Khaleda Zia and her government were involved in that attack and that is why after the brutal incident, police and law enforcement personnel had charged baton on those who tried to rescue the injured and take them to hospitals for treatment."

Previously, the tribunal rejected their bail petition submitted by their lawyer.

In addition, from the second half of the nineteenth century, Bengali educated and wealthy gentlemen began travelling to England mainly to pursue higher education.","Migration of Bengalis from South Asia to the outside world started with taking up jobs as lascars (sailors) in the British East India Company's ships which carried precious goods from the Indian subcontinent, such as spice, tea and cotton. In addition, from the second half of the nineteenth century, Bengali educated and wealthy gentlemen began travelling to England mainly to pursue higher education.
Most of the students were men but a few Bengali women including Kadambini Ganguly (1861-1923) from Jessore travelled to Scotland to study medicine. She then went on to work as a doctor, campaigned for women's rights and gave birth to eight children. When a magazine slandered her by calling her a ""whore"" she sued for damages and the editor was thrown into prison. All these and many other unknown interesting anecdotes are compiled in a new book titled 'Bengali Settlement in Britain' by Faruque Ahmed.
Bengali lascars who had migrated earlier did not wish to settle permanently in England but to return to their native country. Majority of the lascars came from the province of Bengal, now Bangladesh, and in particular from the region of Sylhet, Chittagong, Noakhali and Comilla.
They began settling sparsely in the UK from the 1930s-1940s, a pattern which became widespread during 1950s-1960s. Some Bengalis married English women and in a charming passage, the new book records their wives' names, including Mrs Mohammed, Mrs Peeroo, Calcutta Louisa and Lascar Sally.
To feed their hunger for spice, canteens were established. Bengali chefs produced dishes such as macher jhal. In 1937, an Indian tourist made a list of 16 Indian restaurants across Britain and the book's author reckons there were more than 70 Indian restaurants and another 50 Indian cafés in London by 1946.
Catering remains the principal business venture of the Bengali community in the UK. There are now over eight thousand Indian restaurants in the UK and at least 90% of them are owned and manged by Bengalis. The sector employs as many as one hundred thousand workers and its yearly revenue is more than four billion pounds.
Today, the descendants of these Bengali settlers are identified as British Bengalis. They have taken themselves to new heights through their success in all major sectors, be it in the mainstream education or careers, business or politics. Bengali doctors have found employment within the National Health Service (NHS). Barristers and accountants have started their own businesses and some entrepreneurs have made fortunes through textiles, catering and trading. The community is thriving in all aspects of life, as well as maintaining their rich Bengali cultural identity.
Faruque Ahmed has conducted extensive research on the UK Bengali community for almost three decades and has authored his latest book 'Bengali Settlement in Britain' with a history of about 400 years of migration of Bengalis to the UK. For his book he collected many untold or forgotten stories of Bengali settlers. The book will not only fascinate the history readers but will also thrill the general readers. It will assist the future generation in searching for their roots and heritage too.
'Bengali Settlement in Britain', published by the Dhaka-based University Press Limited (UPL), is currently available in Kindle edition from Amazon. The book will soon be published in print form and in Bengali."

","The plan to offload an additional 15.2 per cent shares of state-run Rupali Bank has been revived after a delay caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the lender's preoccupation in disbursing stimulus packages. 
Last month, Md Obayed Ullah Al Masud, managing director of the state lender, requested the Financial Institutions Division of the finance ministry to take the necessary steps for the secondary offering.
A secondary offering is the sale of new or closely held shares by a company that has already made an initial public offering (IPO).
Rupali was listed with the stock exchanges in 1986, with 9.8 per cent of its shares now up for trade.
The decision to offload another 15.2 per cent shares of the bank came at a meeting on 9 February, where it was decided to list five state-run lenders in the stock market by September as part of the government move to prop up the ailing bourse.
As per plans, a quarter of the shares of Sonali, Agrani, Janata, Rupali and Bangladesh Development Bank (BDBL) would be offloaded.
BDBL is supposed to offload 25 per cent share, Janata and Agrani to offload 10 per cent to a maximum 25 per cent shares.
As Sonali acts as a treasury bank for the government, a decision on the country's largest bank would be taken later.   
Rupali was supposed to offload the shares by May. But the issue got stuck because of the pandemic, which brought the economy to a standstill and forced the government to keep the country under a strict lockdown at least from 26 March to 30 May before easing resections from June.
Now that economic activities are returning to a version of normalcy, the issue has been hauled up again. And on 13 July, the board of Rupali gave its approval to offload more than 6.3 crore new shares in phases, depending on the situation in the market and share prices.
It was also decided that the shares would be offloaded through the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB) and Rupali Bank Securities, a subsidiary of the bank.
A committee has already been formed to work on the listing of the banks, which will be coordinated by the state-owned merchant bank ICB. Its subsidiary ICB Capital Management and respective banks' subsidiary merchant banks would jointly act as issue managers.
As Rupali has capital shortfall as per Basel-III guidelines, the proceedings from the share sale would be injected into the bank.
On Thursday, Rupali's share traded at Tk 30.6 on the Dhaka Stock Exchange. But the letter said the net asset value of the share is Tk 41.1, according to the bank's 2019 financial report.
The company issued 5 per cent stock dividend in 2019, 10 per cent in 2018, 24 per cent in 2017, 10 per cent in 2016, 15 per cent in 2015, 15 per cent in 2014, 15 per cent in 2013, 10 per cent in 2012, 20 per cent in 2011, and 10 per cent in 2010, data from DSE and Rupali Bank showed.
The government has formed a committee led by Abdullah Harun Pasha, additional secretary of the Financial Institutions Division, to oversee the process of listing the state-run lenders.
Banks have formed committees to take the IPO process forward.
A senior official of Agrani Bank said it had already formed a committee and the issue would be fast-tracked.
""We were busy with disbursing the funds under the stimulus packages,"" he added.
Shibli Rubayat Ul Islam, chairman of the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission, welcomed the move.
""It is good news for the stock market. We want to approve the fund-raising at several stages so that Rupali's fundraising doesn't impact the turnover of the secondary market,"" Islam added.
Offloading shares of government-owned companies will be a blessing for the stock market because investors would be allowed to invest in profitable companies, said a top official of a merchant banker.
Besides, the bourse has not seen the floatation of many good stocks in recent times.
If the government lists low-performing companies or the ones that are suffering from losses such as Sonali, then the market will be impacted, the merchant banker added.
Some of the listed government companies are Atlas Bangladesh, Bangladesh Services, Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company, Bangladesh Shipping Corporation, Dhaka Electric Supply Company, Eastern Cables, Eastern Lubricants, ICB, Jamuna Oil, Meghna Petroleum, National Tubes and Padma Oil.
Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, Shyampur Sugar Mills, Titas Gas, Usmania Glass Sheet Factory, Zeal Bangla Sugar Mills and Renwick Jajneswar and Co are also listed."

","The Dhaka Stock Exchange is coming to the rescue of stockbrokers as the premier bourse is set to increase their share buying capacity without the need to keep security deposits.
The move comes following demand from brokers who can now buy stocks of Tk 10 crore a day without keeping security deposits or providing bank guarantees.
""As the turnover of the market has gone up, we need to have some advantages such as the capacity to buy more shares without security deposits,"" said a top official of a stockbroker asking not to be named.
Turnover, an important indicator of the market, was Tk 1,155 crore a day on an average in the last two weeks, according to data from DSE.
""The turnover of the market will go up further once the bond market becomes vibrant. So, such a measure from DSE was necessary,"" the official added.
The premier bourse has already sought approval from the stock market regulator to raise the limit based on the performance and net assets of the stockbrokers.
The limit would be two times the daily average turnover or 50 per cent of the TREC-holder (trading right entitlement certificate-holder) company's net worth, whichever is lower, according to DSE's proposal.
The bourse proposed to divide the brokers into five categories from A to E based on their performance.
The A category brokerage houses with an average daily turnover of more than Tk 10 crore might be allowed to buy shares worth Tk 30 crore without any security deposits, according to the proposal.
The limit could be Tk 20 crore for the second category brokerage houses whose average daily turnover is Tk 5 crore to Tk 10 crore.
DSE suggested the C category brokerage houses whose average daily turnover is Tk 2 crore to Tk 5 crore should be allowed to buy shares of Tk 15 crore.
The D category brokerage houses with Tk 1-2 crore average daily turnover would get the Tk 5 crore-limit and the E category brokerage houses with less than Tk 1 crore average daily turnover might be allowed to buy shares of Tk 1 crore.
As the stock market has been bearish for long, stockbrokers are struggling to run their business, said another stockbroker and a leader of DSE Brokers' Association.
So, it is very difficult to set aside a higher amount of security deposits.
If the rules are relaxed, the costs will come down, which may ultimately benefit the market, he added.
""We want to ease the difficulties the stockbrokers face, but at the same time, we have to keep in mind the investors' interests,"" said a senior official of the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission.
A decision will be made on the proposals of DSE very soon, he added.
DSEX, the benchmark index of DSE, rose 90.8 points or 1.9 per cent week-on-week to stand at 4,794.1.
Among the large-cap sectors, non-bank financial institutions posted the highest positive change with 8.19 per cent gain in the week.
The daily average turnover increased 8.54 per cent to reach Tk 1,179 crore.
Beximco Pharmaceuticals topped the turnover chart with Tk 68 crore a day on average followed by Beximco, Orion Pharmaceuticals, IFIC Bank and Brac Bank.
Savar Refractories was on the top of the gainers' list, rising 54 per cent during the week, followed by Zeal Bangla, BIFC, Orion Pharmaceuticals and Exim Bank First Mutual Fund."

","The government is considering giving priority to leasing out state-owned jute mills to the private sector so that production could resume within a short time, according to officials of the textiles and jute ministry and industry stakeholders.
The development comes after the ministry found a greater response from private millers in taking on the 25 mills shuttered last month instead of the other options it had floated, including public-private partnerships (PPP).
Some millers said the PPP process was time-consuming and complex and they lacked the knowledge and experience to operate under the system.
The views came in the first two meetings of the 13-member committee headed by Textiles and Jute Minister Golam Dastagir Gazi held on 23 July and 5 August.
Some participants suggested declaring the machinery to be scrap while some recommended dividing the mills into three categories to be leased out, modernised and brought under the PPP.
Proposals were also placed for handing over some mills to the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) and the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority, according to minutes of the meetings.
The government formed the panel on 16 July to recommend measures to modernise the production system of jute goods in light of the present and future market prospects and to restart the plants under the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC).
The panel comprises the executive chairman of BIDA; secretaries to finance, commerce, industries and textiles ministries; a director-general at the Prime Minister's Office; and presidents of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the Bangladesh Jute Mills Association (BJMA) and the Bangladesh Jute Spinners Association.
The government closed down all 25 jute mills that employed 24,886 permanent workers and a large number of casual workers from 1 July to bring an end to continuing losses resulting from the use of decades-old machinery, corruption, mismanagement and operational costs higher than those in the private sector.
Since the closure, the government has been maintaining that it would give the factories, which were nationalised in 1972, a new lease on life either under the PPP, government-to-government initiatives, joint venture or on lease.
Initially, the committee decided not to sell the lands of the closed jute mills for any other purpose, according to minutes of the first meeting.
In its second meeting, the committee decided to ""consider leasing out mills as an effective and useful method to restart mills within a short time"" by keeping the government's ownership on land and other properties.
It also decided to consider other options based on circumstances.
As per the decision, BJMC also offered scope for interested investors to visit the shuttered plants such that they could see the condition of the factories and other properties.
Some 24 interested investors visited the mills located in Chattogram, Khulna and Dhaka divisions. The deadline for visiting the mills ended on 20 July.
BJMC Chairman Md Abdur Rouf, however, said interested investors would be able to visit factories if they want. On the method of the handover, he declined to comment.
Mohammad Abul Kalam, member secretary of the committee, said leasing those out was an option.
""All the options are on the table. We have not decided on anything yet,"" he added.
The investors would not be interested in taking rent of the mills for short periods, said Mohammed Mahbubur Rahman Patwari, chairman of BJMA.
As the government says it will not sell the land, no other option will be feasible other than a long-term lease, he said, adding that the government understands that the lease format would be easier to jumpstart production at the mills at the earliest.
He favoured giving out leases for 99 to 100 years as banks will not provide finance to those not on a long-term lease.
As the mills had been established a long time ago, many pieces of machinery had become old and their capacities had eroded, said Patwari, who has visited some of the mills adjacent to Dhaka.
""As the machinery is old, new owners will have to start anew,""
The panel also decided to determine the recovery value of the machinery and divide mills into three categories depending on the condition of the machinery, said Patwari, also a member of the committee.
Aameir Alihussain, managing director of steelmaker BSRM, said they wanted to explore the potential for investment in the state jute mills.
""We are interested subject to due diligence,"" he said, while urging the authorities for making all the information available, give time and ensure clarity."

But it was found flowing in a sewer in the country's north-western city of Rajshahi yesterday. In fact, a lot of money, in notes of one hundred, five hundred, one thousand, and various other denominations.
Besides money, prize bonds, numerous documents of bank accounts and welfare funds, and vouchers worth lakhs of taka of Rajshahi Road Transport Group were also found in the sewer. Some of the documents were from 2011.
All of this was found in a sewer that runs along the Rajshahi-Dhaka highway, right outside the boundary wall of the Rajshahi Railway Hospital, located on the east side of the Rajshahi Railway Station, said officials of General Railway Police and Boalia Police Station.
Contacted, Matiul Haque, general secretary of the Rajshahi Road Transport Owners Group, said their staffers threw some old papers into the sewer.
""Those papers were old and rotting in our balcony. Without burning the papers, the staff mistakenly threw them down the drain.""
He couldn't say for sure how the money got there though.
From morning to afternoon, more than 50 people were seen kneeling in the sewers and fetching money from the sewer channel, while thousands gathered around the spot.
One Sakib came to the location around 3pm. He said he searched for half-an-hour and found two five-hundred and one hundred taka notes. He said those who came here in the morning found a lot more. A railway security guard said he saw someone gather Tk 10,000 alone, while a child told this correspondent that he found three 20 taka notes.
A woman said she heard from a rickshaw-puller that he got Tk 50,000. ""While urinating on the sewer bank, the rickshaw-puller noticed money flowing in the drain,"" she said. ""I came here to see it with my own eyes after hearing it directly from him.""
Nibaran Chandra Barman, officer-in-charge of Boalia Police Station, said they have looked into the matter, but did not take any action as the area was out of their jurisdiction.
The railway police avoided the incident too.
OC Shah Kamal of railway police said since the location of the sewer is outside the railway boundary, they took no action in spite of being informed of it.
Even though he is not certain, Road Transport Owners Group's Matiul referred to an old incident and said the money might have something to do with it.
Three years ago, Bipul, an employee of the organisation, lost about Tk 2.5 lakh belonging to a bus owner. He kept the money inside his desk drawer at the group's office, but later said he couldn't find it.
Bipul is still repaying the lost money to the bus owner from his salary. The group has also given him a grant of Tk 1 lakh to complete the repayment. But whereabouts of the lost money remained unknown, he added.
""We think that the person who took the money hid it in the pile of paper. But our office was under CCTV camera network and no one dared to go there, get the money, and get out. When the papers were dumped in the drain, the money might have gone along with them,"" said Matiul.
However, Matiul said the total money collected by locals would not be more than Tk 3,000."

It also said any interaction, ideas, thoughts or information, including any ""hazardous occurrences or natural disaster"" shall not be given using Facebook, Viber or Whatsapp etc.
However, officials would be allowed to use e-mails, SMS or written documents to maintain communication with the superiors, colleagues and subordinates, it said.
The authority sent a letter to all departments concerned of the project on Saturday, sources said.
The directive comes at a time when construction works of the project is facing huge challenge due to Covid-19 pandemic and strong current in the Padma river. No span could not be installed after June 10, when the 31st span was installed, due to strong current on the river, officials said.
Besides, at least 192 railway stingers and 220 roadway decks, supposed to be used for construction of the bridge, fell into the Padma on July 31 as erosion hit a part of the bridge project's construction yard.
Although the erosion will not affect the main Padma bridge site as it occurred nearly two kilometres off the bridge site, it may cause some delay as the railway stingers have to be imported from Luxembourg.
""I have received a letter not to share any photo or information on social media. I think all officials involved in the project got the letter too,"" an official of the project said, wishing not be named.
Contacted, Project Director Shafiqul Islam said admitted giving such an instruction. ""More than 5,000 people are working in the project. Should I allow all to share photo in the social media?"" he told The Daily Star yesterday.
Asked whether sharing photo or videos of the project was causing any problem, he said, ""Yes, this is causing some problems.""
Many people are posting on social media or uploading video on YouTube mixing some true and false information regarding the project, he said.
""We have asked our officials not to share photo or document on social media,"" he said.
Construction of the Padma Bridge started in November 2014 to connect the country's southwestern region with the capital through road and rail links.
The current deadline of the project is June 2021.
The project cost rose to Tk 30,193 crore following several revisions of the deadline.
However, the current deadline is going to be deferred further due to the Covid-19 pandemic and strong current in Padma, officials said. The overall progress of the project was around 80 percent till June this year.
Once opened, the 6.15km-long bridge will connect the capital with 21 southern districts. It is expected to boost the country's gross domestic product by 1.2 percent."

","The Dhaka Central Jail authorities today said they received court directives asking them to take measures for treatment of photojournalist Shafiqul Islam Kajol but he cannot be treated outside the jail premises due to the ongoing pandemic.
""The court has ordered to take steps for his treatment. There is a hospital inside the jail and he is being treated there accordingly,"" Mahbubul Islam, jailer at Dhaka Central Jail, told The Daily Star last night.
When asked about possible treatment plans outside, the jailer said ""You can understand the current situation. There is no scope to admit anyone in hospitals outside the jail premises due to coronavirus. If there is any major health problem and the jail doctor thinks it is needed, then we can think about it.""
Asked about Kajol's health condition, the jailer said he can't comment on this and only the doctor can speak of such matters.
Dhaka Central Jail has two doctors. Among them, Mahmudul Hasan Shuvo, chief doctor at the Dhaka Central Jail told this newspaper that he was infected with coronavirus and right now is on leave. ""I don't know any updates about journalist Kajol,"" he said.
One of the prison guards wishing anonymity said ""Earlier 15-20 inmates used to take treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital per day.""
But as of Saturday, there were only two inmates admitted at DMCH. The inmates with only major problems will be sent outside jail for treatment, he said.
Meanwhile Kajol's son Monorom Polok said unable to find any scope of meeting his father, he ended up talking to him over phone around two weeks back. Kajol told his son that he was unwell.
""He said that his left arm has become paralysed and he can't do anything using that hand. He is also frequently vomiting, sometimes with blood,"" Polok said.
Kajol's family later contacted the lawyer and appealed to the court for medical treatment for Kajol. The court responded to the request and directed the jail authorities to comply.
""But the authorities are still keeping my father in jail, not even admitting him to any hospital for better treatment,"" Polok added.
Kajol has been in Dhaka Central Jail after being arrested in cases under the Digital Security Act.
RIGHTS BODY EXPRESSED DEEP CONCERN
Expressing deep concern over the jail authorities' slackness, the rights body Ain O Salish Kendra said despite giving instructions, the prison authorities have not yet taken any action for Kajol's treatment.
Kajol has been kept in jail for almost three months in controversial cases during the coronavirus pandemic.
The rights body demanded immediate medical treatment and immediate release of the imprisoned journalist.
Fifty-three days into his disappearance, Kajol was found by Border Guard Bangladesh in Benapole of Jashore on May 3. He was then arrested initially on charges of trespassing, but was granted bail by a Jashore court.
Later in the evening, he was shown held under section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure after police informed the court that three more cases under the Digital Security Act (DSA) against Kajol were pending with different police stations in the capital.
The court then sent him to Jashore Jail. Later, he was shifted to the jail in Keraniganj."

","Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity today demanded that the government withdraw the 60 percent bus fare hike immediately to stop disorder over bus fare and harassment of the passengers.
The passengers' welfare platform made the appeal through a press statement, signed by its secretary-general Mozammel Hoque Chowdhury.
The statement said the government announced 60 percent bus fare hike on condition that the bus operators will carry 50 percent passengers of the capacity and will follow health safety guidelines.
But none of the public transport are following the health safety guidelines, rather they are carrying extra passengers as done in pre-Covid-19 situation, it said.
As a result, common people, who are already facing economic hardship due to Covid-19 situation, are enduring immense suffering in regards to transportation, and in many cases, transport workers and passengers are locking into altercation over the fare, it added.
The organisation also said when the government hikes bus fare, fare of other transport like human hauler, auto-rickshaw also doubles, causing further woes for passengers.
The organisation demanded reintroducing the previous fare.
Services of public transport, including buses and minibuses, resumed on June 1 after more than two months. The government had suspended the services on March 26 to contain the spread of the virus.
Following demands by transport leaders, the government hiked bus fares by 60 percent from June 1 on the condition that buses would carry passengers at half capacity and follow other health safety guidelines."

Apart from the health risks of the coronavirus, the food we eat, the way we work and how physically active we are having all been changed and impacted in ways hardly imaginable only a few months ago. ","The COVID-19 pandemic is presenting unprecedented challenges around the world. Apart from the health risks of the coronavirus, the food we eat, the way we work and how physically active we are having all been changed and impacted in ways hardly imaginable only a few months ago. As time goes by, we are learning more about COVID-19 and it is now becoming clear that people with non-communicable diseases are more likely to have severe symptoms.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has characterised both the COVID-19 outbreak and obesity 'epidemic' as international public health emergencies and it may be one of the most important predictors of severe coronavirus illness, new studies say. According to WHO, in 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults were overweight, of whom 650 million were classed as obese.
Researchers know people with obesity have a higher level of inflammation in their bodies, which can impede the body's immune response and make it more difficult to fight coronavirus. When the virus comes and infects, then this inflammation seems to become more pronounced. This can contribute to this very strong immune response that is seen in COVID-19. Serious outcomes for COVID-19 can now be added to the long list of other diseases and complications including cardiovascular disease and asthma that are a consequence of obesity.
Patients with obesity often have respiratory dysfunction, obesity is also associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and kidney diseases and comorbidities that are considered to result in increased vulnerability to pneumonia-associated organ failures. Measurement of anthropometric characteristics and metabolic parametres is crucial to better estimate the risk of complications in patients with COVID-19.
Scientists have discovered that an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), present in cells, is the main way for the virus to enter the body. Higher levels of this molecule are thought to be found in adipose tissue or fatty tissue, which people who are obese have more of - under the skin and around their organs. Top of everything else, the ability of the body to fight off the virus - known as the immune response - is not as good in people who are obese. That is due to inflammation driven by immune cells called macrophages which invade our fat tissue. They interfere with how our cells respond to infection. According to scientists, this can lead to a 'cytokine storm' - a potentially life-threatening over-reaction of the body's immune system which causes inflammation and serious harm.
Given our health systems are already stretched with obesity-related illnesses, there is no better time than now, to tell the public that the time to change their diet is now. COVID-19 has really put a highlight on this because it is so sudden and unexpected. But it does shine a light on the importance of obesity prevention at a public health level.
No one is arguing that slim and fit people are safe because obesity is not something that can be changed overnight. It is not a time to panic about your weight, but it could be a good time to concentrate on healthier choices.
These restrictions can be challenging and might lead to reduced physical activity and eating for comfort or to ease boredom, potentially resulting in weight gain. The best way is to eat a healthy, balanced diet and exercise regularly. Otherwise, try to eat slowly and avoid situations where you could be tempted to overeat.
A healthy lifestyle will not only lower your risk of disease but also ensure your immune system is working at its best, which is essential now.

Although it's a term we hear often, most of us are unaware of what graphic designing actually is and what a job in this field really entails.","When we hear the title ""graphic designer"", we immediately visualise a person frantically clicking on a mouse with their back bent towards a bright screen. Somehow, the frantic clicking produces colourful arts, logos and illustrations, and at first glance it may all look complicated.
Then the question arises, what is graphic designing? Although it's a term we hear often, most of us are unaware of what graphic designing actually is and what a job in this field really entails.
Simply put, it is a form of visual communication with the use of typography, photography, illustration, motion graphics, etc. So, your job can include making logos for small and big brands, designing user interfaces for applications or websites, making book cover designs for aspiring authors, album cover designs for your favourite artists—the list goes on.
Now that we know what it is, how do you build a career in graphic designing?
To get an idea of the basic skills required to begin your journey in this field, we spoke to Md. Harun Ar Rashid, Assistant Professor, Department of Graphic Design, Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka.
""In general, most jobs in the field require some use of the various Adobe software available, and Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator are important software to master for any job in this field,"" he comments. Although Adobe dominates the market, there are alternatives available. CorelDRAW and Inkscape are great substitutes for Adobe Illustrator for vector art; and GIMP can be a great alternative for Adobe Photoshop for raster art. Since Adobe has a subscription fee, newcomers in this field may also be interested in the free and open-source software such as Inkscape and GIMP.
For learning, various materials are at your disposal online. YouTube can be a great platform for grasping the basics. One of our favourite channels is Gareth David Studio as this channel provides a well-rounded introduction to a lot of Adobe products. If one is interested in earning certificates, they can enrol in their desired graphic designing courses online on platforms such as Udemy and Coursera. There are also multiple books that one can find online. But, throughout the whole learning process it is just as important to continuously keep applying and honing your creative skills.
After acquiring the necessary technical skills, the next step is looking at work. Graphic designing is a vast field with opportunities almost everywhere. If you really consider it, there are few job sectors that don't require a graphic designer. Starting from ad designs for businesses to making a motion graphics video to explain science to school children, almost every field needs their help. As a result, the career opportunities are endless. It is evident that the demand for graphic designers and illustrators will always be there. The visual design industry is growing in Bangladesh, and it is safe to assume that there will be more opportunities in this field in the near future.
""I personally think that this industry will only grow bigger in the future,"" says Tafsir Ul Huq, a freelance graphic designer. ""Brands want to make their social media presence felt, and for that, they need good visuals. Hence, they turn to agencies, or independent designers to get the job done. You could also work for newspapers, and different online media outlets. They too need good visuals to attract readers towards their content.""
""In short, there will always be a need for unique and eye-catching visuals,"" Tafsir adds. ""This in turn, will always ensure the need for graphic designers in the industry.""
The most important asset at this stage is to have a diverse work portfolio. Harun Ar Rashid shares, ""The first thing employers want to see when hiring a graphic designer is how good their work is. A degree or a certificate is of little use to the employer if they do not like the individual's work.""
Although there are degree programs for this field, such as the ones offered by the Faculty of Fine Art in University of Dhaka, most employers judge designers on their skills and existing work and not on the certificates they have. This is one reason this field is currently attracting a lot of young designers because they realise that this is a career opportunity they can benefit from without having to pursue an academic degree. They can either take short graphic design courses in different private institutions, or learn as much as they can from the internet, before heading out in search for work or building a career in this industry.
In terms of being a good designer, Harun Ar Rashid adds, ""The most important thing to keep in mind is client service. A good design will conform exactly to the clients' requests. Therefore, good communication skills are highly important. Furthermore, some technical aspects must be kept in mind to ensure a clean and crisp production of the design. Aesthetics of the design is definitely important but even if a design is aesthetically pleasing but has a lot of technical issues, it will automatically be rendered a bad design.""
Now, as a graphic designer, you have the option to work full-time as well as a freelancer. Each has its own benefits and concerns. The choice will be yours to make.
""With freelancing, you get to work on your own accord, but you don't face many challenges which can deter self-development in some sense,"" says Harun Ar Rashid. ""As a full-time graphic designer, you get to work beside other designers and so you develop and gain more experience in the field.""
Tafsir made the huge decision of quitting his full-time job as a graphic designer to focus solely on a freelancing career. He was motivated by the benefits of freelancing, and was ready to take a few risks.
""I moved to freelancing once I realised that it was more profitable for me,"" Tafsir explains. ""The pay is good, and I'm really enjoying the freedom I have right now. Of course, there's the concern that I might not always have a project to work on, but I've decided to take the risk, and thankfully, it's bringing me good results.""
""Life as a graphic designer in a digital agency is quite hard,"" he adds. ""And you don't always work 9 to 5. The work rate varies, and sadly the pay isn't that good in most of our local full-time graphic design jobs.""
""Freelancing isn't easy either,"" claims Tafsir. ""If you're looking to work as a freelancer for the rest of your life, you need to work extra hard. You'll also have to struggle a lot at the beginning. Finding clients or projects will be very difficult for newcomers. However, if you're patient and have a good work ethic, you'll find a way sooner or later.""
There's no doubt that the opportunities are endless in the design industry, but that doesn't mean success will come to you if you sit idle instead of working hard for it.
""A common trait among new artists or graphic designers is the idea that they're going to get work right from the start,"" says Junaid Iqbal Ishmam, freelance cartoonist and illustrator, and In-Charge of Operations at Cartoon People. ""However, that's not entirely certain. They'll have to fight for their place in the industry, which is already very competitive.""
""As a visual artist or designer, your primary concern should be self-development,"" Ishmam asserts. ""Practice a lot, and study the work of others. Once you've mastered the skills, and have a good portfolio that you can show, you don't have to look for work or clients. They'll come looking for you.""
For some people, graphic design is something that starts out as a hobby and ends up becoming a profession. In such cases, it's very important to draw the line between the two.
Tafsir explains that when designing as a hobby, one doesn't really need to work on the advice or suggestions of others. ""You can take opinions as they come and go. But as a professional, you can never do that. You need to take criticism seriously, and work on it. There will be times when you need to revise a design over and over again, just to get it in accordance to the client's specifications and needs. If you're not good at incorporating suggestions, or working with constructive criticism, you can never really succeed.""
At the end of the day, working as graphic or visual designer seems like a pretty good career choice. For many people, it's a passion for creativity turned into a profession; to start graphic designing as a hobby, and ultimately stick with it for a living. That being said, like all other professions, you'll probably have to deal with a lot of failures along the way before you can actually become an expert of your work. That's all part of the process, and whether you like it or not, you'll need to face it head on before you can fully grow as a successful graphic designer.

Subsequently, the CGS Unit of BB issued a circular on July 27 defining the scope and detailing other aspects of the scheme such as, the eligibility criteria for scheduled banks and financial institutions (FIs) as well as for enterprises, application procedure, fee structure, responsibilities of the scheduled banks and FIs, claim settlement, etc. ","In a bid to support the cottage, micro, and small enterprises (CMSEs) mired in financial difficulty caused by Covid-19, Bangladesh Bank approved a credit guarantee scheme (CGS) worth Tk 20,000 crore on July 23, 2020. Subsequently, the CGS Unit of BB issued a circular on July 27 defining the scope and detailing other aspects of the scheme such as, the eligibility criteria for scheduled banks and financial institutions (FIs) as well as for enterprises, application procedure, fee structure, responsibilities of the scheduled banks and FIs, claim settlement, etc. Following the implementation of the scheme, CMSEs which fail to meet the collateral requirements of the banks or other FIs, can be provided with the support from the CGS. Although late, it has responded to the long-standing market demand for such a scheme providing third-party credit risk mitigation to CMSE lending institutions.  
The timing of the CGS introduction marginally follows those introduced in Kenya and Colombia. At a time when credit risk is heightened and lenders have become more risk-averse, especially when it comes to lending to the CMSEs, the introduction of CGS holds promises. However, I would like to discuss several factors that the Bangladesh Bank should consider in order to ensure that the CGS achieves its expected goals.
The CGS in Bangladesh, modelled as a Hybrid Portfolio Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme is, in general, a well-designed scheme that ensures all parties have a skin in the game. To avail themselves of the CGS facility, first, banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) have to apply for participation in the CGS programme. After signing up for a 5-year long agreement, FIs will have to pay an initial annual fee called guarantee fee of 1 percent of the total value of an individual loan to avail themselves of the guarantee for that loan. This fee will be lower for subsequent years for a guaranteed loan if the FIs can maintain a non-performing loan (NPL) rate of 5 percent or less. If a loan under the CGS goes bad, a participating FI will get 80 percent coverage of a credit given to an individual or a company while the FI will have to bear the risk of 20 percent of the loan amount. While assessing loan applications, FIs are required by the CGS to stick to their internal loan policies. While the newly introduced CGS is predicated on these conditions, there are other nitty-gritties of the scheme that an interested reader can easily look up from BB's SMESPD Circular No 03.
While the design of the CGS is mostly in line with international best practices, there is an opportunity for the CGS to benefit from certain reparameterizations. One of the main eligibility criteria that an FI needs to fulfil to be able to participate in the CGS is a minimum of 3 years of SME lending experience. While the intent is clear from BB—ensure that the guarantee is available to appropriate FIs which know how to deal with SMEs—the policy does not provide a clear guidance as far as the definition of ""SME lending experience"" is concerned. Will an FI that has been lending to SMEs for 5 years, with SME loans constituting only 0.05 percent of their portfolio, be eligible to participate in the scheme? Let's assume that the answer to this question is yes. Next consider another FI which started lending to SMEs only 2 years ago, but already has an SME portfolio that accounts for 10 percent of its total loan portfolio. Why would the second FI not be eligible for the CGS facility despite having a larger share of SME portfolio? These are some practical issues that may arise down the line and BB need to consider them ahead of time to avoid hiccups during full-fledged rollout of the scheme.
Another CGS eligibility criterion for FIs stipulates that only those FIs which maintained an NPL rate of 10 percent or less in the preceding year will qualify for CGS participation. However, this criterion along with the aforementioned one do not apply to state-owned banks. This has an important implication for creating a non-level playing field for banks. In particular, this sends a wrong signal to the market where commercial banks may see themselves at a disadvantage in comparison with the state-owned banks. To put it differently, a state-owned bank with subpar performance receiving a guarantee fund will cause a crowding-out effect on the funds that could be made available for better performing non-state-owned FIs. Moreover, this differential policy may further exacerbate the moral hazard that state-owned banks in developing countries often exhibit. As a minimum, BB may consider imposing conditions on state-owned banks (with NPL rate exceeding 10 percent) to improve their internal control and loan underwriting policies before allowing them to avail themselves of the CGS facility.
Another design related aspect that needs attention is the claim settlement process when a guaranteed loan defaults. The success of any CGS scheme depends critically on the ease of this process. In order to encourage the FIs to use CGS, the claim settlement process should not be complex, time-consuming, or costly. In line with international best practices, the CGS in Bangladesh requires the lending institutions to make all possible efforts to recover a loan as they would have done for non-guaranteed loans. In addition, the lending institutions are required to file cases according to the Money Loan Court Act 2003 (Artho Rin Adalot Ayeen 2003). However, this requirement may act as a deterrent to issuing small loans by FIs.
Commercial banks, in particular, may not find it financially attractive to lend to small borrowers if they have to resort to legal recourses when these borrowers default. As a result, the CGS may fail to support the most underserved section of the borrowers. In this regard, BB may follow the CGS policy germane to claim settlement process stipulated by the government of India. According to India's CGS policy, ""initiation of legal proceedings as a pre-condition for invoking of guarantees shall be waived for credit facilities having aggregate outstanding up to Rs 50,000, subject to the condition that…a Committee of the Member Lending Institution (MLI) headed by an Officer not below the rank of General Manager should examine all such accounts and take a decision for not initiating legal action, and for filing claim under the Scheme."" Bangladesh Bank should also consider establishing such a threshold aggregate outstanding for credit facilities.
In order to ensure that lack of interests do not mar the potential of CGS in Bangladesh, a strong awareness raising campaign should be designed and implemented to inform both the supply side and the demand side of the CGS facility. Otherwise, information asymmetry between the lender and prospective borrowers may lead to suboptimal usage of the CGS funds. In this regard, Bangladesh should take lessons from recent international experiences. For example, Colombia launched a partial CGS in April 2020 which still has not been able to sensitise the banks which have become more risk-averse in terms of lending to the SMEs during the pandemic. While one-time seminars or workshops are useful to introduce the new facility, FIs should be communicated to at different levels (CEO, manager etc.) on a regular basis such that they can retain their trust in the CGS facility. The same is true for CSMEs which are the target of the scheme in Bangladesh.
While CGS has the potential to channel funds to the section of the economy which has limited access to finance, it is not a panacea for all CSMEs. Reportedly, more than 90 percent of the CSMEs in Bangladesh are informal which are not registered with any government authority and do not maintain any financial records. As a result, these CSMEs are highly unlikely to benefit from the newly implemented CGS since commercial banks do not usually lend to informal businesses because of higher perceived risks. In order to ensure that these CSMEs can obtain support from CGS soon enough, the government should consider designing, revamping, and aggressively implementing financial literacy programmes around the country which will encourage more CSMEs to become formalised.
Finally, the government may consider enacting a Secured Transaction Law as has already been done by several African countries (and also some Latin American and Southeast Asian countries) with Ghana being the pioneer. This will allow the establishment of a collateral registry that will enable FIs to register their claims on assets pledged as collaterals by borrowers. This will abate the FIs' concerns over the same collaterals being pledged by the borrowers at different FIs simultaneously. In addition to immovable properties such as lands or buildings, the law will also allow movable properties such as laptops, accounts receivables, inventories, etc. to be used as collaterals for loans. Such a collateral registry may not only lead to a reduction (probably a small one) in the risk premium charged by the FIs but will also encourage FIs to increase their lending activity in the CSME sphere without financial support from BB. This is an opportune time for the Bangladesh government to facilitate the establishment of the collateral registry which can be another milestone to achieve following the rollout of the CGS.

www.thedailystar.net/opinion/news/poverty-alleviation-projects-require-stronger-monitoring-1949189,Opinion,2020-08-23T00:00:00+06:00,2020-08-23T00:00:00+06:00,Poverty alleviation projects require stronger monitoring,"Government projects targeting the poor, like any other projects, if not well planned and properly implemented, will not yield their desired outcomes. ","Government projects targeting the poor, like any other projects, if not well planned and properly implemented, will not yield their desired outcomes. On July 28, the government slashed the allocation of two projects focusing on poverty reduction: ""Income Support Programme for the Poorest Project"" and ""Amar Bari Amar Khamar Project"". The objectives of the first project was to benefit six lakh poorest pregnant women and lactating mothers and 27 lakh poor people across 43 Upazilas in four of the poorest districts which are Gaibandha, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat and Nilphamari. The second project had a nation-wide coverage and was targeted to benefit 54.6 lakh poor people through agriculture-based income generation activities.  
In case of both these projects, there have been some implementation issues that prompted the reduction of funding which will ultimately affect poverty alleviation efforts for the poor and vulnerable people in the country. The various weaknesses in project implementation and management in general such as frequent amendments, cost escalation, delays, time extensions, etc. the Planning Ministry seriously regretted during a high level meeting attended by all secretaries from all the ministries and divisions, on August 13.
The state of poverty has deteriorated during the last four months due to the widespread economic woes resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic—after significant gains in poverty reduction were made over the last three decades. As per the Planning Commission, the percentage of the ultra-poor in total population has gone up from 10.5 percent to 20.5 percent as of June, 2020. In this situation, the government should make best possible efforts at implementation and monitoring of projects so that their impact on poverty reduction is truly felt.
Since a large-scale out migration of population from the cities to the rural areas has taken place during the last four months due to loss of employment and income, for the first time in decades, it is plausible that a significant pressure on poor families are being generated by the in-comers due to sharing of food with their family members. This is bringing down average food consumption which is affecting nutrition levels. Those who used to work in urban areas and sent money to their families living in the villages, have themselves become burdens upon their own families. This phenomena is forcing millions of families to slip back into the poverty bracket.
It is important to note that the two above projects whose budget has been curtailed, are funded from the government's revenue budget. In fact, most of the projects/programmes for the poor, alternatively called social safety net schemes, are funded through the revenue budget.
In Bangladesh, there is no central monitoring system for social safety net projects/programmes. The progress of implementation are monitored by the respective projects/programmes themselves. However, the monitoring arrangements and practices are not well established in these programmes. The Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) under the Ministry of Planning conducts monitoring activities of the development projects as per its mandate. In 1984, when the IMED was established from its parent organisation, Project Monitoring Division, established in 1977, it has been monitoring several hundred projects included in the Annual Development Programme every year.
However, IMED is not responsible for monitoring projects/programmes funded through the revenue budget of the government. Most of the social safety net programmes are funded from revenue budget and IMED is not monitoring them.
In general, the social safety net programmes and projects have weak monitoring capacity. The National Social Security Strategy (NSSS) adopted in 2015 has recognised the weakness in their monitoring capacity and recommended to build a strong results-based monitoring and evaluation system for the social safety net schemes. A technical assistance project is currently being implemented by the government to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation capacity of the social security sector in the country.
Monitoring is an ongoing process that collects routine information to find out whether a project is making progress as per its planned objectives. Proper monitoring should continuously collect critical information, give status of project implementation, assess benefits derived by the target population, and measure the knowledge and skills acquired by the target people with project support.
Currently, monitoring of social safety net projects and programmes in Bangladesh is limited to tracking of activities implemented. Primarily, it covers progress achieved in terms of cash disbursement, food distribution, number of beneficiaries enrolled, training/meetings conducted, and awareness promotion materials produced. No programmes and projects have adequate tools to conduct in-depth monitoring. The monitoring process is not systematically used to assess the actual changes in status of the target families, identify weaknesses and undertake improvements in project implementation. There is no system to track desired results from these projects/programmes and find out whether the ultimate objectives of the interventions which are: improving the overall well-being of the target population, reduction of poverty, employment generation, technical capacity improvements, etc., have been achieved or not.
Most of the social safety net programmes do not have detailed logical framework and thus it is difficult to comprehend what specific results they are trying to achieve. These do not have adequate measurement standards and guidelines, i.e., performance indicators, data collection and use norms, baselines, quality control and reporting procedures.
For effective implementation, there is a need to monitor the programmes more systematically. Routine monitoring and data collection is a necessity in social security related projects and programmes since these are funded out of the revenue budget of the government and monitoring is weaker compared to the development projects and programmes. Systematic and routine monitoring are essential to assess the intervention quality, processes and measurement of performance of inputs, outputs and outcomes. In the absence of strong monitoring system, there will be some shocks, as in the case of the two poverty reduction projects, ""Income Support Programme for the Poorest Project"" and ""Amar Bari Amar Khamar Project"", whose funding were cancelled.

Turns out he was unimpressed by my background which was a newly-finished wall in eggshell white granite tiles from Italy. My friends thought it was super cool as a neutral, earthy, calming background for online video meetings. Boss felt I was being paid too much,"" Shame-Im-Hasan, 40+/-, woefully said his work woes.
""So I changed it to a wall that had damp and mold on it for the poverty look. Boss was still upset until I changed my background by installing the latest fad: a bookshelf. Everybody now listened to what I had to say. I was suddenly important,"" he recalled.
The Zoom background has become a growing issue during the pandemic where everyone has to attend online meetings with nothing but their expressions and bland personalities on display. The blank walls behind them put the participants in stark contrast.
""I feel like I have to perform and be more expressive. That's too much pressure,"" says Krysten Stewart, actress from the hit movie about sentient blood-thirsty sparkly glitters.
Shame-Im, meanwhile, has now been promoted because he appears so well read. ""I had to buy books but it is a small price to pay. Well, it was actually a big price to pay. Damn bookshelf needed 307 books to fill."" 
Bookshelf sales have gone up by 47 percent in the capital city of Dhaka. Mohila Kabir, CEO of EasyPeasy, pivoted her business from growing peas easily using cheap labour to making and delivering bookshelves all across Bangladesh.
She said, ""In 2019, it was important to dress properly and have the right whiff of Eau Sauvage by Christian Dior. 2020 is all about the right video call backgrounds and none of that fake digital mess. Do it right with our bookshelves.""
One Satireday staffer was fired for putting up a background of Putin riding a bear. His firing saved the publication many monies but now we also need an editor because he was the editor.
Some enterprising digital geniuses have come up with an alternative.
Lolita Karim, singer/songwriter/restaurateur/obituary designer, has said she printed out a bookshelf and pasted it on the wall behind her, making her look impressively intellectual. Now men are even more afraid to talk to her. All this for only taka 600."

The fear of losing friends and family was added to it as well since every now and then I would hear news of acquaintances getting affected by or dying due to Covid-19.

","It was early January when I first got to know about the outbreak of Covid-19 in China. Back then, very few people were anticipating a pandemic, and I wasn't one of them.
Being an HSC examinee, I focused on my preparation as I had been preparing myself for the past two years. When I was days away from appearing for my final board exam, coronavirus first broke out in Bangladesh. Having read news about lockdown in countries dealing with the outbreak, I knew what that meant for HSC candidates: more time for preparation and revision.
While the spread of the virus to Bangladesh did scare me to an extent, truth be told, I was also somewhat happy because an imminent shutdown translated to postponement of HSC and that in turn meant more time for quality revision.
The first few weeks were marked by relaxation and a break from study. I was naïve to think that this indefinitely long pseudo-lockdown would help me in preparing myself better for HSC, but in truth, it did the opposite. I started forgetting most of the material I went through in the past and lost determination to go through it again. With the progression of time, my impatience for taking the exam kept growing since there was no indication of any tentative exam schedule. As no deadline was in sight, any intention of studying for HSC properly was on hold too.
Does studying even make sense if I don't know how long my memory has to retain everything? All of this paved the way for my daily dose of cumulative stress. The fear of losing friends and family was added to it as well since every now and then I would hear news of acquaintances getting affected by or dying due to Covid-19.
Fast forward to August, I've lost the mentality to appear for HSC. Rumours of institutions reopening amidst the pandemic are circulating nowadays; they terrify me. While I want to see the end of this viral horror so that normal life can resume, I don't want a hurried resumption of normal life either as this would inevitably lead to HSC. I heavily doubt if I can still achieve the result which I expected from myself before March. If HSC takes place at any cost, numerous students like me would fail to obtain their desired grades and marks, which would further worsen our mental health.
Furthermore, Bangladesh is still in the first wave of this pandemic whereas numerous countries have already entered the second wave. Even if the situation does improve in Bangladesh and the government decides to hold the HSC exams, this might trigger the second wave in Bangladesh and some of the exams might need to be rescheduled again, and dates being changed mid-exam is the last thing any candidate would want. These are the reasons why I can't stress enough how I wish the authorities seriously considered predictive grades as an alternative to holding HSC (multiple countries have taken similar steps to my knowledge). That way, HSC examinees would have one fewer thing to worry about (as if worrying about university admission season weren't enough).
Only time can tell what lies ahead of HSC 2020 candidates. Perhaps predictive grades will be  considered to lessen our burden, or the wait for exam dates will extend indefinitely as everyone's anxiety worsens daily.

They're now dealing with impacts of mistakes they didn't make.

","The A Level results came out last week after this year's exams were cancelled due to Covid-19. The grades were given by an algorithm looking at past performances of the students and their exam centres.
For many, grades have been ridiculously downgraded from their AS results or predicted grades. In England itself, 40 percent of the teachers' assessments were downgraded compared to the 2.2 percent upgraded results. The results have invalidated the past few years of hard work on the students' part, as these grades have severe consequences on their futures. They're now dealing with impacts of mistakes they didn't make.
While grades dropping from A*/A to B/C has been a common sight, what left several baffled is a drastic drop to D/E.
Wasif Ahmed*, from S.F.X. Greenherald International School says, ""I got an E in A Level Mathematics from a 91 percent in AS which would only happen if I got below 8 (out of 100) in my A2 exams!""
A Levels are defining points for students applying home and abroad. Ahnaf Mashrur, from Scholastica, mentions how he can't apply to most domestic universities anymore, ""Given how badly I got downgraded—an A to E in Economics, B to D in Business Studies—I'm incapable of applying to public universities like IBA, DU and BUP, where I'd need at least 2 Cs to even sit for the admission exams. I can't really try for private universities either."" Even those who qualify with Bs and Cs will have lower marks because of their lower overall GPA.
Students who got conditional offers or scholarships face the prospect of losing them. Students who opted for gap years can't apply according to their plans. Most universities won't accept Ds/Es for admission.
Purba Das*, from DPS STS School Dhaka, planned on applying to the UK with her AS results, but her downgraded grades barely meet the entry requirements. ""I would require an A in Mathematics for most Russell Group universities, which I was confident about getting as my mocks' average was an A grade. But because I ended up getting a B, I'm now having to look into other courses and universities.""
For most students I talked to, their primary choice is going for a re-evaluation. Wasif has the SAT and IELTS lined up, and Ahnaf can't afford to lose months in his academic career. But the process is confusing with loopholes, which feels like the system has been designed to lead the students to retakes in the November session. Individuals can't appeal for their grades to be changed as the entire group would then be reviewed, and Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE) won't change the rank orders used. Most schools are overwhelmed with the students' complaints, and several teachers have confirmed that students' grades didn't match their assessments. While some authorities are reassuring their students, others have been evasive.
With the lack of proper explanation of the evaluation system by CAIE, looming university applications, and the ongoing pandemic, students face uncertainty from all directions. Retakes call for more money from middle class families who already struggled to pay the registration fees, and there's risk in taking exams in the current situation. On the other hand, there's no guarantee appeals will work.

Sohel Mondal: No, I have been in four other films before.","Rafi Hossain: Shohel, is this your first film?

Sohel Mondal: No, I have been in four other films before.
Rafi Hossain: What are your opinions on the entertainment industries of the two Bengals collaborating?
Sohel Mondal: I believe that the two Bengals working together in the entertainment industry would be financially beneficial, and this should be pursued further.
Rafi Hossain: Tell us more about your experience.
Sohel Mondal: Being a part of such a project at the beginning of my career has been a valuable experience for me, and it will definitely help me in the future. Working with such renowned directors and actors has been an honour, and I have learnt a lot.
 
Rafi Hossain: Congratulations on the film. I have watched it and I really loved it. You combined two of Manik Bandopadhyay's stories. Did you add your own flair to it?

Indranil Roychowdhury: I would say that the plot has almost no similarities with the original story. The true similarity lies in the aura and sentiment. The original is set in the beginning of 1950, but our plot is set in Kolkata in 2018-2019. The social settings are completely different. What remains the same is the the relationships between the people, the lack of reliance and the common insecurities. The external dynamics are not the same at all.
Rafi Hossain: Can you talk about the title of the film?
Indranil Roychowdhury: There is an underlying sense of destruction in the film. The film also heavily expresses how people don't know what to do with each other. They can't love no matter how much they want to. They can't rely on someone when they need to. They are in a constant state of mentally tormenting themselves. Most characters in the film are like this. That is where the title came from.
Rafi Hossain: Do you think there is any difference between the filmmakers and actors in Bangladesh and West Bengal?
Indranil Roychowdhury: I haven't worked with too many people, but there is a difference in favour of Bangladesh. Most Kolkata-based filmmakers live in the cities, but Bangladeshi filmmakers live in a dual reality because even if they live in Dhaka, their hometowns are different. So, actors can express themselves with vastly different characters as they have more options in this regard. West Bengali filmmakers are trying and experimenting, but it is very marginal, and I don't think it is making any contribution to the big picture. In saying that, I have to clarify that I know there are lots of talented individuals in Kolkata.
Rafi Hossain: Any final thought you would like to share? 
Indranil Roychowdhury: Although being featured in a festival is amazing, it leads to some people thinking that the film will be unpalatable. They think that they won't understand the film, or it will be too slow-paced and not plot-heavy. I strongly disagree with that. This film will strike a chord in everyone, I believe. The story is about ordinary people, so I advise against rejecting it simply because it is being featured in festivals. It was a beautiful journey creating this film. I had complete freedom in the creative process, for which I am grateful.
 
Rafi Hossain: Do you purposefully portray different kinds of characters? How do you go on about getting into the role?

Bratya Basu: Even though I want to play vastly different roles, there may be some repetitions. Literary personas say that there are only eight kinds of stories around which every creation is made. So, how truly different can characters be if the base is these eight stories? If an actor wants to play in one film in three years, it would not be financially possible in this country. Daniel Day Lewis has only played in twenty films in his lifetime, but that will not be possible for an actor here. They have to work a lot. It isn't possible to create new and different things if someone is not given a break. Even in this, there are amazing works coming out and that is a credit to them.
Rafi Hossain: I think that joint productions lead to the creation of great projects that will benefit both the Bengals. Do you agree?
Bratya Basu: I completely agree with you. Technological advancements have helped us stay connected in such ways that were previously unimaginable, and this connection and communication will lead to the assimilation of different cultural aspects across people. Joint productions like these help to strengthen the communication and help people understand each other, which will, in turn, open up a series of opportunities for both the nation, be it politically or economically. I think our film has been successful in achieving that somewhat.
Rafi Hossain: Would you like to share any final sentiment? 
Bratya Basu: We are thrilled that this film is being featured in big film festivals. I hope that the pandemic is over soon, so that people can go to cinema halls again and watch films to their hearts' content. I hope that they start with Mayar Jonjal.
 
Rafi Hossain: Ritwick, we have seen you do so many different types of roles. How do you make sure that your roles do not become too similar, and when you pick a role, how do you decide how the character will be like?

Ritwick Chakraborty: When picking roles, I make sure to see if it is too similar to any character I have played in the past. However, since I act a lot, there will be some characters that are similar to each other. When that does happen, I pay a lot of attention to the script and try to find ways to make the character different. Instead of making ideas up in my head regarding the character, I follow what the script says and make the character unique. I don't have any specific method which I use to make sure that I don't pick similar characters.
Rafi: You have done many experimental and mainstream films. What has your experience in the industry been like?
Ritwick Chakraborty: When I first started acting, I used to hear that my face is not very suited to play the role of a hero. But, I never paid much heed to those because I was not very interested in playing that role. However, my look has proved to help me now. Whenever there is a character about someone who is not from South Kolkata, I am the first person they come to. So, whenever there is a very different kind of role, I have a high chance of being able to play it. With the rise of unique characters like the ones I play, I feel that I will be able to play more characters in the years to come. I consider myself extremely fortunate for this.
Rafi: How was your experience working with Aupee Karim?
Ritwick Chakraborty: In this project, we had many events not occurring in the foreground, and we had to rely a lot on our expressions, rather than the use of too many dialogues. This was especially the case for Aupee as her character relied a lot on her expressions. To portray this character perfectly, we needed a very good actor, and after watching the film, I realised that Aupee did a fantastic job. While filming, I did not realise just how good she is. I think that if anyone else except her did this, the character would not have been portrayed this perfectly. Sometimes, when working with other actors, I have come across people who make you purposefully uncomfortable, but Aupee was not like that. She would do whatever she could to make me comfortable. She was very professional and would work with a lot of effort. To me, that is the sign of a good actor. So, working with Aupee was a great experience.
Rafi: How do you feel about Bangladesh and West Bengal doing joint venture films?
Ritwick Chakraborty: As an actor, I would always want joint ventures like this to happen as this enables people from both sides to showcase their talents to a much larger audience. I think that if we work together and utilise the talents from both sides, we can actually get out of the crisis we are currently facing. And, I would love to have more people working with me and also getting to show my work to a larger market. I think that since we have very similar cultures, we should explore the slight differences there are. Joint venture projects can only help us, so we should always keep on doing them.
Rafi: Do you have any parting message?
Ritwick Chakraborty: Mayar Jonjal has been featured in a very prominent film festival. All of us involved with this film want people from both sides to watch it. We worked very hard on this project, and it would mean a lot to all of us if our work is appreciated. And, since we are talking about both Bengals doing joint venture films, I think that we should all be very vocal about our interest in doing them.
 
Rafi Hossain: Aupee, I want to start by congratulating you on the movie coming out. I personally believe you were outstanding in it. Could you share your experience with us?

Aupee Karim: I always try to follow the guidelines provided by the director. I studied the script and tried to understand his perspective, and carried out the work the way I was asked. All the credits go to the creator of the movie. The script itself was also very captivating, and so, when the director was reading it out loud, I could already picture the scenes in my head.
Rafi Hossain: Tell us about your experience working with Ritwick.
Aupee Karim: Firstly, I would like to thank Ritwick for saying such kind words about me. It has been an honour to share a screen with him as I truly admire his work. As for his talents as an actor, I have no words that would do him justice. I always enjoy working if my co-workers are as dedicated to the project as I am. That is one of the reasons I loved working with him. Moreover, his acting is always natural and not over-the-top, which made every scene seem just like a regular conversation. Overall, it was an amazing experience, and I want to continue being a part of projects such as this. I want to thank Ritwick and Indranil Roy Chowdhury for this experience.
Rafi Hossain: What are your opinions on the two Bengals collaborating in terms of the entertainment industry?
Aupee Karim: This is one of the reasons I starred in a film after so long. The story and the crew were wonderful and it also brought the two Bengals together. The internet has made it easy for us to access movies and television shows from all over the world. So, I believe it will only be beneficial for the entertainment industry if the two Bengals to work with each other, be it from a financial, political or cultural standpoint.
Rafi Hossain: Do you haveany parting message?
Aupee Karim: Because of the festival, the film has already reached the audience. As an actor, however, I am still looking forward to the day the film will be released in cinema halls in both countries."

Lyon forwards Memphis Depay and Karl Toko Ekambi missed gilt-edged opportunities in the opening 16 minutes of their 3-0 defeat by Bayern in the semi-final on Wednesday and Rooney has warned that PSG's front three of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Angel Di Maria will not be so wasteful.
""Bayern have the advantage that most of their starting line-up have played in the Champions League final before. But I have a feeling for PSG,"" Rooney, who won the Champions League with Manchester United in 2008, wrote in his column for the Sunday Times.
""It will be a shoot-out and I think with Neymar, Mbappe and Di Maria, PSG will exploit the high line that Bayern play. They will get chances and take them.
""I have no doubt that press will create chances for Bayern but PSG are good enough in possession to deal with it and once they play through it there will be opportunities for their attackers.""
The spotlight will no doubt be on Mbappe and Neymar who have combined for eight goals and nine assists in the competition thus far but Rooney, 34, believes it's his former Manchester United team mate Di Maria that could make the difference.
""PSG's match-winner might just be Di Maria. He's a wonderful player. He works tirelessly on the pitch and his delivery, vision and awareness is brilliant,"" Rooney said."

","UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin says the single-game knockout format, used in the Champions League this year from the quarter-final onwards, has produced more exciting football than the usual two-legged games and could be revisited in the future.
The format was changed in order to allow the competition to be completed in a shorter time-span after the COVID-19 pandemic halted play for several months across Europe in March.
Eight clubs headed to Lisbon and the final will be contested later on Sunday, pitting Bayern Munich against Paris St Germain.
""We were forced to do it but in the end we see that we found out something new. So we will think about it in the future for sure,"" Ceferin told Reuters in an interview.
The UEFA president said that without a second-leg to fall back on, teams have been forced to go for goals.
""(There has been) not so much tactics. If it is one match, if one team scores then the other has to score as soon as possible. If it is two legged system then there is still time to win the next match,"" he said.
""More exciting matches for sure but of course we also have to think about the fact that we have less matches and broadcasters (can) say 'you don't have as many matches as before, this is different' so we will have to discuss when this crazy situation ends.""
The 'final eight' tournament took place without fans in stadiums and the prospect of supporters from eight clubs descending on one city could cause security issues among other logistical problems.
The current format is locked in place contractually until 2024/2025 but discussions are due to begin later this year on the structure for the competition for the next phase.
Congested Calendar 
The tournament was played over 11 days and clearing space in the congested international calendar would be another obstacle to overcome but Ceferin is clearly intrigued by the possibilities.
""Look for sure it is a very interesting format. Now, I doubt as much as the calendar is now, that we could do a final eight (tournament), because it would take too much time. But a format with one match and a system like it is now, I think it would be much more exciting than the format that was before,"" he said.
""If we would play this system then, but we haven't discussed with anyone its just an idea, we would play in one city. If you play in one city, you can have a week of football or something like that. But it is far too early to think about it.
""We have seen it as a big success and the viewership over TV has been huge, maybe it also good because it is August and people are at home, some of them at least, but interesting, interesting tournament.""
As well as the Champions League, UEFA has also held a similar tournament to complete the Europa League season and has held the finales to the UEFA Youth League and the UEFA Women's Champions League.
""It was not an easy task, trust me. We are the only organisation in the world which organises international events (with) four events in four countries, which has been an extreme challenge for us,"" he said.
Over 12,000 COVID tests have been carried on players and staff at the UEFA tournaments.
""The most challenging was everything connected to health and this virus which is spreading all around the world. We try to control everybody, to be locked to be, separated from the rest of the world, but it is a huge challenge."""

","Bayern Munich can complete only the second treble in their proud history by beating Paris Saint Germain in Sunday's Champions League final to underline their status as Germany's super club.
Bayern have cruised to the Lisbon final, scoring 42 goals in their Champions League matches. In all competitions, they are on a 20-game winning streak stretching back to early February.
""We don't have to say anything more about Bayern Munich, because their opponents will no longer be beaten but destroyed,"" grumbled Borrusia Dortmund chief execurive Hans-Joachim Watzke in the wake of the 8-2 quarterfinal drubbing of Barcelona.
On the other side, Paris feature the best defence in the Champions League. But their attack, orchestrated by Neymar, is capable of damaging the German champions.
German great Lothar Matthaeus warned Bayern about 'stability' in defence, also encouraging them to dump the high line in defence that leaves spaces in behind for the pacey Kylian Mbappe to exploit, something Lyon did as well.
""In attack, Bayern still have their quality, but at the back they need to be more stable. Maybe against Paris they shouldn't defend so high, because Paris will use the speed of Neymar and Mbappe"".
Bayern coach Hansi Flick agreed with that assessment, but was not willing to change the high pressure system that Bayern have imbued with a ruthless streak.
""We were lucky to hold out in the first phase of the match (vs Lyon),"" admitted Flick. ""We'll have to see that we organise the defence a little differently. Our great strength is pressuring on the opponent and I think that we will succeed against Paris as well.""
Even the great Franz Beckenbauer stepped in to caution the Germans, saying: ""I've watched PSG's games, they're one heck of a team. It'll be the most difficult game of this Champions League season. I can't find any weak points in the team and I expect them to vary their playing style. I hope that both teams don't hold back too much, don't show each other too much respect and play just as refreshingly and with a joie de vivre like they have done up to now. Then we can expect a wonderful final.
""It'll be a match played on equal terms. I'd say it's 50-50. Sometimes you need luck. If Bayern get that, they'll win the game.""
Angel di Maria has been inspirational for Le Parisiens and he also sees the match as a finely balanced contest.
""They're tough, they're a really well-organised team, and I think this will be their 11th European Cup final,"" Di Maria said. ""We know they have amazing players, players in incredible form, but we also have good players, our own system, our own way of playing, and I think we have a group that deserves to win the Champions League.""
History is on PSG's side.  The two sides have faced off on eight occasions, all of them Champions League encounters, and Munich have walked off as losers five times, although they won the last encounter.
The difference-maker for the French side could be Neymar, who scored in both legs against Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 and cried afterwards. He was excellent against Atalanta in the quarterfinals and magnificent against Leipzig in the semifinals, even if he did not score in either game.
PSG will hope the Brazilian -- who has scored 70 times altogether in 84 matches for them -- has been saving his next goal for the final. ""I hope that the good lord will help him to score on Sunday and us to win,"" said his compatriot Thiago Silva.
He added: ""Speaking of Bayern Munich is easy. All of us who enjoy football see Bayern Munich as a role model in both the European and world stage. A team that plays with a high intensity and has a lot of quality.
""From their keeper, who is among the greatest in the world, to their striker who is the current top scorer in this season's [UEFA] Champions League, and has been putting in great performances. Bayern Munich must be regarded as one the best teams in the world.
""We must respect their team, and try to play in our style, as we've been doing all season, to play at our highest level. And we're aware of all that comes along with a final, the motivation on the other side."""

From a tournament normally played in Cincinnati but moved to New York because of the coronavirus pandemic to masked ball boys and girls, there was very little normal about the return of professional men's tennis.
With no spectators allowed into the sprawling Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, matches were played in eerie silence under the shadow of the massive Arthur Ashe Stadium that will be centerstage when the U.S. Open starts on Aug. 31.
Working his way back to match fitness after undergoing a second hip surgery in January, Murray got his first tournament of 2020 off to a positive start by surviving a near two-hour, 30-minute challenge from Tiafoe to reach the second round where a sterner test awaits in fifth seed Alexander Zverev.
""My goal is to come in and my hip to be feeling good,"" said three-times Grand Slam champion Murray.
""That's what I wanted so I don't mind how much tennis I get to play, I know that will come the practice, the more matches I get but the concern for me is my hip going to be well enough,"" the 33-year-old Briton added.
If Murray's game showed rust, his battling instincts remained sharp, particularly in the first set tiebreak when he trailed 5-2 before fighting back to take control.
Tiafoe secured his only break to go up 5-4 in the second on the way to leveling the match but Murray, twice Western and Southern champion, broke the young American at the first opportunity in the third and closed out victory.
Canadian 12th seed Denis Shapovalov showed little rust in his first tournament since February as he reeled off nine aces to dispose of 2016 champion Marin Cilic 6-3 6-3.
With the win, Shapovalov, who faced just one break point over the course of the contest, improved his head-to-head record against the Croatian to 3-1.
Big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic fired 19 aces to topple Sam Querrey 6-4 6-4 and set up a second-round clash with either Dan Evans or Russian 10th seed Andrey Rublev.
Women's play began with a rematch of the Shenzhen final in January and another upset as Russia's Ekaterina Alexandrova toppled ninth seed Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan 7-5 7-6(6).
Croatian 15th seed Donna Vekic was also a first-round casualty, falling 6-2 6-3 to twice Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka of Belarus.
The tournament also lost one of its marquee names when 13th- seeded Greek Maria Sakkari dispatched Coco Gauff 6-1 6-3 to spoil the 16-year-old American's Western and Southern debut.
After a run to the Lexington semi-finals last week Gauff was put under pressure by her Greek opponent, committing 24 unforced errors and hitting only six winners.
Amanda Anisimova eased to a 6-3 6-3 victory in an all-American clash against 11th seed Alison Riske, while seven-time Slam champion Venus Williams was another high-profile casualty as she fell to Ukrainian 16th seed Dayana Yastremska 5-7 6-2 7-5."

She had to visit the Dhaka Geneva Camp to conduct a survey for academic purposes. ,"Ribana started Bunon with only an investment of BDT 500 and a pair of crochet sticks without any concreate planning. She had to visit the Dhaka Geneva Camp to conduct a survey for academic purposes. This is when the struggles of the women from the Bihari community residing there, especially in terms of gaining economic stability, came to her knowledge. With Ribana's determination and relentless efforts from her team, Bunon gradually gained ground as a proper e-commerce platform on social media. It also helped the members to establish their own identities, in their respective circles.
As a social business focused on economically uplifting women, Bunon actively trains and employs them, making them financially stable, while lending a hand in the national economy. ""It takes us two to five days to teach the basics of crochet arts to a girl. We have five trainers who are always available to our beginners,"" mentions Ribana when asked about their vocational training structure. ""The trainers help them through this process, which is enough to start working. Then, we slowly introduce the design-based work to them.""
Girls who gain expertise in the weaving technique eventually become trainers and help the novices. ""I have been with Bunon from the beginning. After joining this organisation, I could support myself financially and even contribute to my family,"" shares Khaleda Binte Alam, a trainer at Bunon. ""Besides, I enjoy working with others and learning new things. I hope to stay with this initiative for as long as I can.""
Bunon, as an organisation, brought huge changes in the lifestyles of these women, allowing them to walk with their heads held high. ""Before joining Bunon, I faced many obstacles with work and was struggling to provide proper education for my children,"" says Forida Begum, the lead worker at Bunon. ""But now, they are studying and the other women in my family have started working too. We are no longer fully dependent on our family. Instead, we have become a support system for them.""
Even as the world is grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, the members of Bunon are working from home and sending out handmade products through home delivery services. Working equipment with detailed briefing and raw materials are delivered to the workers' homes once a week, and collected by the end of the week. Ribana personally calls each of the workers from time to time, while the trainers ensure that they understand the designs and colour preferences, as per the orders' details.
Ribana aspires to reach out to a lot more women who want to be financially independent, but are struggling to find such opportunities. She dreams of opening an outlet in the city and extend her measures, to be able to employ at least 2,000 women. She had also started taking up online orders to ship abroad. However, those are on hold for the time being. ""I believe that in the next 30 years, the women in Bangladesh will be economically empowered through their own skills,"" concludes Ribana."

Texas-based OnwardMobility will work with a Foxconn Technology Group subsidiary on a BlackBerry smartphone powered by Android software and tailored for 5G networks, the companies said in a joint release.

BlackBerry announced early this year that Chinese electronics group TCL will no longer have rights to design, make or sell its smartphones as of the end of August.

The new smartphone will make its debut in Europe and North America, and be designed to appeal to the increasing number of people working remotely, according to the release.

""Enterprise professionals are eager for secure 5G devices that enable productivity, without sacrificing the user experience,"" said OnwardMobility chief executive  Peter Franklin.

""BlackBerry smartphones are known for protecting communications, privacy, and data.""

Franklin added that the deal would ""deliver a new 5G Android BlackBerry smartphone with a physical keyboard.""

BlackBerry's share of the global smartphone market has fallen to virtually zero since it dominated the market with its keyboard design a decade ago.

The rise of Apple's iOS and Android-powered handsets with touchscreens prompted BlackBerry to abandon the market to concentrate on software and services.

BlackBerry, based in Canada, licensed its smartphone technology to TCL in 2016 in a failed effort to revive its fortunes.

The agreement announced on Tuesday gives OnwardMobility the right to develop, engineer, and market a BlackBerry 5G smartphone.

FIH Mobile, a subsidiary Taiwan-based Foxconn, is to design and manufacture the new device."

Iran in May supplied gasoline to Venezuela to ease chronic shortages, triggering alarm bells in Washington as the two countries expand trade relations amid efforts to undermine aggressive US sanctions programs.
""It had not occurred to me, it had not occurred to us,"" Maduro said during a televised broadcast with cabinet members, instructing Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino to follow up and jokingly telling his cabinet to keep the plan a secret.
""Padrino, what a good idea, to speak with Iran to see what short, medium and long range missiles they have, and if it is possible, given the great relations we have with Iran.""
Colombian President Ivan Duque said on Thursday that Maduro is looking to buy Iranian missiles and is handing over weapons made in Russia and Belarus to Colombian armed groups, citing intelligence reports.
Weapons purchases appear relatively unlikely for Maduro, whose government is struggling to buy basic food and medicine or to provide fuel to the population due sanctions as well as chronic dysfunction of the country's refineries."

Of them, Jahid, Rashed and Sumon are now in jail while Mintu and Russell are on the run.
After conclusion of arguments, both the from prosecution and defence, Judge KM Emrul Kayesh of the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court of Dhaka today set the judgment date.
Earlier, the court recorded statements of 23 prosecution witnesses, including complainant of the case.
According to the case statement, a group of 25-26 policemen -- including SI Jahid -- raided a house during a wedding ceremony in Pallabi's Irani camp area and arrested Jonny on February 8, 2014.
Informer Sumon and two of his friends including Russell called police after Jonny slapped him for stalking women at a programme.
Police allegedly tortured Jonny at the police station.
After Jonny fell sick the next day, he was admitted at a local clinic. Later, he was transferred to Suhrawardy Hospital where doctors declared him dead.

","Bangladesh rejects any notion of local integration of the Rohingyas and is committed to ensuring their repatriation to Myanmar, Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen said today.
""Bangladesh is fully convinced that Rohingyas must go back to Myanmar under conditions that they don't return here again,"" he said at a webinar on ""Rohingya Crisis: Western, Asian, and Bilateral Perspectives"".
""We reject any notion of local integration,"" he said.
The Center for Peace Studies (CPS) of South Asian Institute of Policy and Governance (SIPG), North South University, organised it in partnership with the High Commission of Canada as the Rohingya influx approaches third anniversary Tuesday.
Some 750,000 Rohingyas fled a brutal military campaign since August 25, 2017 and took shelter in Bangladesh, joining some 300,000 others who had fled earlier waves of violence since the 1980s.
Over the last three years, two attempts of repatriation under the insistence of Myanmar and some other countries failed as Rohingyas said the situation in Rakhine state was not safe and they did not have guarantee of citizenship and other fundamental rights.
Masud Bin Momen said now, considering the Covid-19 situation and conflicts in Rakhine, it seems Myanmar is making the Rohingya return difficult.
He also said Bangladesh is not allowing any third country resettlement of the Rohingyas on a basis where any country will take only a few members of the community.
However, he said, it can be considered if some countries work under a joint plan to settle some half a million Rohingyas to their countries.
The foreign secretary sought global cooperation in solving the Rohingya crisis that seems to be protracted."

They were determined to educate disadvantaged communities about COVID-19. Some of the members are studying abroad, whilst two of them are students of IUT and through their reach, they were able to accumulate more than sufficient funds to work towards their goals.
They began their work by educating daily labourers and rickshaw pullers about the virus, alongside distributing around 500 masks. They reached out to around 1,000 people. They also provided food to around 400 people, especially to families of four, who were not able to afford meals three times a day. During Ramadan, they organised the campaign, 'Project Hashimukh', in which they fed the elderly at old age homes. They also allocated Eid packages to Dhaka and Barisal, besides providing iftar to over 600 people. They collaborated with BANDHU, Project Pothchola, Project Konna, Give Bangladesh, Madchef and Shunte Ki Pao to provide iftar to 100 people in one day.
Moreover, the organisation's campaign, 'Amphan Response Project' to provide food for around 60 families in the flood afflicted region of Satkhira. For their 'Project Niramoy' they collaborated with Docterio, a telemedicine-based startup, to connect professional doctors with patients online, free of cost. The patients could ask to communicate with doctors regarding any disease. Their 'Eid For All Campaign' enabled them to contact generous donors, one of whom provided them a cow for slaughter. They distributed food to around 100 families and 400 individuals prior to Eid-Ul-Azha.
According to co-founder Farhan Faiyaz, they have around 30 volunteers who are called Porikolpona Foundation Changemakers. They focus on helping people in the respective areas they live in. Due to the pandemic, only the co-founders who are in the city, move around for the longer commutes. While working, they make sure to remain sanitised and wear masks.
Since the start of their venture from the end of March 2020, Porikolpona Foundation accumulated over BDT 500, 000 to help feed around 5000 people, for at least a week. In the future, they hope to attain a sustainable position so as to be able to rely less on donations and more on their capability to provide for their own causes."

Subsequently, easy and generous financing for them, particularly the micro, small and women entrepreneurs, has become urgent and imperative.
The SMEs contribute about one-fourth the country's gross domestic product and employ millions of people.
Still, a large number of the micro, cottage and small businesses have remained missing from formal financing and the government-announced Tk 20,000 crore stimulus package for the sector.
This was shared at an online discussion jointly organised by LankaBangla Finance and The Daily Star on supporting the SMEs to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic.
Planning Minister MA Mannan was present among others.
Discussants said the pandemic induced a long shutdown, which was a catastrophe for the SMEs, especially micro and small businesses that mostly operate informally.
The SMEs suffered Tk 92,000 crore in losses during the shutdown, said Monzur Hossain, a senior research fellow of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS).
They are yet to recover even though there are signs of a resumption of economic activities, he said, citing one of his latest studies on the impact of the pandemic on the SMEs.
""Therefore, the implementation of the stimulus package is vital for the SMEs.""
A majority of the micro and small businesses do not have access to bank finance because they operate informally and cannot prepare documents in line with the requirements of formal financial institutions.
A certain portion of the stimulus can be delivered through microfinance institutions along with taking support from SME Foundation for the benefit of small businesses, Hossain added.
The SMEs are the engine of development and it is particularly true for a developing country since they provide diversity, employment and value addition, said Selim RF Hussain, managing director and chief executive officer of BRAC Bank.
Some 55 per cent of value-addition in Japan comes through the SMEs, he said.
Small clients of BRAC Bank were on their way to recovery following the withdrawal of the countrywide shutdown by the government from June.
BRAC Bank, one of the biggest financiers of the SMEs, also brought changes in its loan products to fit with the needs of its borrowers, he said.
Initially, responses from the SMEs for the stimulus package were low because of a lack of awareness, said Md Mahbub ul Alam, managing director of Islami Bank Bangladesh.
Awareness increased later and Islami Bank, another major lender to the SMEs, got more applications. The bank provided loans to 2,100 out of 3,600 applicants, he added.
To support micro businesses, Islami Bank also finances through its microfinance window in rural areas, he added.
The macro scenario of loan disbursement does not match with the micro picture, said Mohammad Abu Eusuf, professor of the Department of Development Studies at the University of Dhaka.
Many micro and small businesses and women entrepreneurs continue to be left out from the stimulus package for the SMEs.
""A one size fits all approach will not help.""
Citing his recent study among women entrepreneurs, he said 95 per cent of the respondents did not get the fund.
They are begging at the doors of banks for loans but in vain, said Eusuf, also director of the Centre on Budget and Policy at the University of Dhaka.
""Their situation is different and they should be treated differently,"" he added.
Khwaja Shahriar, MD and CEO of LankaBangla Finance, echoed the same.
""We all should work so that SMEs can recover,"" he added.
The condition of micro and cottage enterprises was very weak and these businesses need support on easy terms, said Ferdaus Ara Begum, chief executive of Business Initiative Leading Development (BUILD).
She urged for increasing the repayment period of loans for small entrepreneurs.
Citing that India offered Rs 3 lakh in collateral-free loans, she demanded granting Tk 2 lakh as collateral-free loans for small and micro businesses.
""Overall, we are lagging behind loan disbursement,"" said Centre for Policy Dialogue Research Director Khondaker Golam Moazzem.
The government's intentions were good but banks were not properly doing their job of implementing the stimulus plan.
They are focusing on lending to those who have. They are showing slackness, he said, demanding that the central bank disclose bank-wise loan disbursements against targets.
""If the economy recovers, why will the SMEs not get loans?"" he asked.
Frustration has gripped many micro and small entrepreneurs as they were not getting any finance, said Nazeem Sattar, general manager of SME Foundation.
Banks are giving priority to their existing clients, he said, while demanding measures to ensure loans for the SMEs that do not get it from banks.
""It is necessary to develop an alternative mechanism for those small businesses that are not served by banks.""
State banks have branches all over the country and they have an important role to play, Sattar added.
The central bank eased application procedures for loans and cut documentation requirements for the SMEs, said Asif Iqbal, joint director of the Bangladesh Bank.
""We have to be prepared to serve a huge demand surge in the post-pandemic period,"" said Planning Minister MA Mannan.
He suggested that the central bank consider ways to relax repayment schedules for the SMEs and energise state banks so that they lend to the SMEs more aggressively.
""The pandemic has created a shift toward virtual marketplaces from physical stores. We have to utilise the digital prospect,"" he said.
Md Kamruzzaman Khan, senior vice-president and head of SME Financial Services of LankaBangla Finance, said the non-bank financial institution gives focus on lending to manufacturing SMEs.
Syed Ashfaqul Haque, executive editor of The Daily Star; Borhan Uddin, executive director of the Institute of International Business & Management; and Shabbir Shawkut, technical advisor-capacity building and public-private dialogue of The Asia Foundation, also spoke."

","The government would hold talks with Chinese officials tomorrow as part of its desperate efforts to give impetus to the mega projects held up by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Bangladesh's development activities came to a grinding halt in late March after the government was compelled to enforce a strict countrywide shutdown to limit the spread of the deadly virus.
The move did not spare the major projects, many of them were already running behind schedule mainly due to uncertainty over funding, complexity over designs, planning and land acquisition.
The construction sector though was expected to get momentum after the government partially lifted the lockdown on 30 May although the pandemic is far from over.  
The two-and-a-half-month-long shutdown has seriously paralysed the implementation of the mega projects as foreign workers and engineers could not join their workplace because of the lockdowns in their home countries and the suspension of commercial flights.
With the reopening of the economy, the government has jumped back to work and is looking to run the major projects in full swing.
This led the government to sit with the officials of the Asian Development Bank and India to discuss how to accelerate the implementation and disbursement of more funds to make up for the losses.
Last week, the Economic Relations Division (ERD) held a meeting with officials of India to accelerate the implementation of the ongoing projects bankrolled by New Delhi.
Now, the finance ministry has decided to hold a virtual meeting with the Chinese embassy in Dhaka and project officials tomorrow to find ways to put them back on track again.
The ministry has set an agenda to discuss the Padma rail link project, the single-point mooring (SPM) with double pipeline project, the multilane road tunnel under the Karnaphuli project and the expansion and strengthening of the power system network under the Dhaka Power Distribution Company area.
They are part of the 27 projects Bangladesh and China agreed to implement during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Dhaka in October 2016, the first by a Chinese president in 30 years.
The world's second-largest economy has promised about $20 billion -- the largest amount yet by a single country -- over the next four years at the time.
Four years on, only a fourth of the amount has entered Bangladesh's aid pipeline.
The outbreak of the coronavirus in China and later in Bangladesh severely affected the Padma Bridge rail link project that was being constructed by China Railway Group.
In early July, the government revised the budget for the SPM with double line project for the second time, increasing it by 21 per cent.
The cost of the project overran by 33 per cent from the original budget because of the delays in securing loans, the appreciation of the US dollar against the taka and a threefold rise in the price of land.
The original cost of the project was about Tk 4,936 crore. In the first revision, it was raised to Tk 5,426.3 crore. The second revision took it to Tk 6,568.3 crore.
In December last year, a new deadline of 30 June 2022 was set.
The SPM will have an annual unloading capacity of 9 million tonnes. It will unload 120,000 tonnes of crude oil in 48 hours and 70,000 tonnes of diesel in 24 hours.
The main objectives of the project are to ensure the unloading of imported crude oil and finished products with ease, safety, at a low cost and within a short time, reducing system losses in the import of crude and finished products through lighterage operations.
It will also maintain a balance between the growing demand of energy and its supply and enhance the petroleum oil retention capacity through the setting up of a diesel and crude oil storage tank farm at Moheshkhali and increasing energy supply.
The Karnaphuli Tunnel project in Chattogram has achieved a breakthrough with the completion of the left line despite the pandemic. China Communications Construction Company is implementing the project.
The tunnel, the first underwater tunnel in South Asia, will connect the port city with the other side of Karnaphuli river, improve traffic movement in Chattogram and promote the economic development of Bangladesh, said the Chinese embassy in Dhaka in a press release on 3 August.
It will also contribute to the improvement of the Asian Highway Network and connectivity between Bangladesh and its neighbours.
The tunnel is being built at a cost of Tk 9,880 crore to turn Chattogram into ""One City, Two Towns"".
Out the 27 projects, commercial agreements for seven projects involving $5.4 billion have been signed as of June 2020. China has disbursed $1.54 billion.
Two more projects involving $439 million that are not included in the list of the 27 projects are also being implemented. Beijing has disbursed $249.3 million for them.
Bangladesh is implementing nine projects bankrolled by China. Disbursement totalled $1.8 billion against the commitment of $7.1 billion as of June, according to the ERD.
Tuesday's meeting will also discuss the next priority list containing the remaining 16 projects. Dhaka has sent the list to Beijing seeking funds.
The list includes Dhaka Ashulia Elevated expressway ($1.2 billion), the double line (dual gauge) between Joydebpur-Ishwardi section ($1 billion), and the conversion of Metre Gauge Railway Track into dual gauge in Akhaura to Sylhet section of Bangladesh Railway ($1.3 billion).
The government would also sit with the World Bank.
Bangladesh is particularly keen to speed up the implementation of the mega projects after the country's annual development programme fell to a 27-year low in the just-concluded fiscal year.
The ministries and divisions managed to spend Tk 161,857 crore in fiscal 2019-20, which was 80.5 per cent of the total allocation for the year.
This fiscal year's ADP is Tk 204,144 crore."

The victim was sent to the one-stop crisis centre at Dhaka Medical College Hospital last night for forensic tests.
Rezaul Karim, a sub-inspector of Rampura Police Station, said the victim and her husband had an altercation over a family row around 10:00pm on Saturday and the husband stormed out in anger.
Then Mohor called the woman over the phone and told her that her husband was staying at his home, nearby the victim's one. He asked her to come take her husband back home.
When she went there, she did not find her husband. Mohor then raped the woman, the SI said, quoting the case statement."

Moreover, the weather has not been favourable.
All tourist sites were closed on March 18 by Chattogram District Administration due to the coronavirus outbreak in the country. It decided to open the sites on August 22 as the ""pandemic situation in the city has improved.""
The administration, however, imposed 16 conditions on the sites' management with adherence to health guidelines, according to officials of Chattogram District Administration.    
On the spot yesterday, it was seen that some twenty visitors were in Foy's Lake Amusement Park in the morning. The staff of the park were seen instructing visitors to follow health guidelines.
Visitors had to wash their hands at a basin at the entrance of the park and wearing a face mask was a must for everybody.
""We emphasised on maintaining health guideline as per the government's instruction,"" said Bishwajit Ghosh, deputy manager (marketing) of Concord Foy's Lake Amusement Park.
""Although the park has opened after five months, turnout of visitors is still very low due to incessant rainfall,"" he said, ""Only 50 people visited the park on Saturday.""
Shamsunnahar came to the park with her seven-year-old daughter and younger sister yesterday.
 ""We were bored staying at the house for months. As the amusement park has opened, we have come here for recreation,"" she told The Daily Star. 
Turnout of visitors was also very poor in Swadhinata Complex, another tourists'  site in the city, which is popularly known as Mini Bangladesh.  
The park also put emphasis on maintaining health rules, with a sign saying ""no mask, no entry"" displayed at the entrance.
Staff of the complex were seen checking the body temperature of visitors with infra red thermometre at the entrance.
Trisha Dey and her husband  Mukul Dutta visited the park yesterday. ""I feel very relaxed to be here after five months,"" said Trisha. She said she was happy to see the
precautionary measures taken by the park authority.
""Turnout of visitors is very low in first two days due to rough weather and risk of infection,"" said Mohammad Ali, manager of Swadhinata Complex. 
""All the health guidelines are strictly being followed in the park,"" he said, ""We check the body temperature of every visitor and make them sanitise their hands.""
""We also sanitise all rides after every round to ensure safety of visitors,"" he added.
Ali expected an increase in the number of visitors in the days to come.
Same situation prevailed in Chattogram Zoo. The zoo opened yesterday (Sunday) after five months but  turnout of visitors was very low. .on the first day.    
""We are trying our best to maintain health guidelines strictly,"" said Shahadat Hossain Shuvo, veterinary surgeon  of the zoo.
""We are not allowing any visitor without face mask and are regularly announcing inside the zoo asking visitors to maintain social distancing,"" he added.
Contacted, Ilias Hossain, deputy commissioner of Chattogram, said they decided to open the tourist destinations with 16 conditions on maintaining health guideline.
When asked how they decided that the outbreak situation has improved, the DC said according to statistics, there is improvement.
""Number of Covid-19 positive cases was 300-400 a day even a month ago but the number dropped  down to double digit nowadays,"" he said, ""But we have no other way but to maintain health guidelines strictly if we want to prevent the situation from deteriorating again."""

Judge KM Emrul Kayesh of the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court of Dhaka passed the order after Kajol's lawyer Barrister Jyotirmoy Barua submitted a criminal appeal against the lower court's rejection order.
Earlier on June 24, Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Dhiman Chandra Mondol had rejected Kajol's bail petition in the case.
During today's hearing, Kajol's lawyer told the court that his client was very sick and one of his hands was ""paralysed"", but the bail was denied.
On August 10, Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Rajesh Chowdhury ordered the jail authorities to arrange better treatment for him. But they were yet to do so, his lawyer alleged.
Meanwhile, today Kajol was taken to the outdoor section of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital around 10:00am for a medical check-up but whisked away without having undergone a ""proper checkup"", alleged his son Monorom Polok.
""My father was not able to walk; he was so unwell. He had to be carried out of the prison van and then placed in a wheelchair. They stayed inside for about half-an-hour and he was carried out again,"" said Polok.
""We could not talk to him when he was being taken in -- we were being shooed away. We ran up to him when he was being taken out and only managed to talk for a second. He said his health is not good,"" added Polok.
Kajol is a cardiac patient, he informed.
Mahbubul Islam, jailer at Dhaka Central Jail, told The Daily Star that he was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up so that they can present a report to the court.
Khurshid Alam, a doctor at Dhaka Central Jail, said Kajol is physically weak and is suffering from a lack of appetite and insomnia. He is also showing signs of being depressed, in addition to other health concerns, the doctor added.
He was taken to BSSMU's outdoor neurology department and the doctors there prescribed some diagnostic tests which can be done at the jail, so he was brought back, Khurshid said, adding Kajol will be transferred immediately to BSMMU if the tests come out poorly and even if nothing shows up, he will be taken for a follow up at BSMMU in a month's time.
Another Dhaka virtual court will tomorrow (August 25) hear a petition submitted for showing Kajol arrested in the same case.
The court on June 16 had sent an email to the jail authorities, scheduling a virtual hearing on the petition and directed authorities of Keraniganj Central Jail in Dhaka to bring Kajol from Jashore jail before the hearing.
Two more cases under the same act were subsequently filed against Kajol on March 10 and 11 with Hazaribagh and Kamrangirchar police stations respectively.
Fifty-three days into his disappearance, Kajol was found by Border Guard Bangladesh in Benapole on May 3.
He was then arrested, initially on charges of trespassing, but was granted bail after being produced before a Jashore court.
Later, he was shown held under section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) after police informed the court that three more cases against Kajol were now pending with different police stations in the capital.
The court then sent him to Jashore jail."

www.thedailystar.net/law-our-rights/news/affidavit-criminal-cases-must-adhere-relevant-laws-1950009,Law & Our Rights,2020-08-24T00:00:00+06:00,2020-08-24T00:00:00+06:00,Affidavit in criminal cases must adhere to relevant laws,"Section 27(1) of the Nari O Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and some other criminal laws require ‘affidavit’ to be filed with the complaint petition. ","Section 27(1) of the Nari O Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and some other criminal laws require 'affidavit' to be filed with the complaint petition. There is no definition of 'affidavit' provided under the Nari O Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 or any other criminal law including the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. However, section 3(3) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 provides that 'affidavit' shall include 'affirmation and declaration in the case of persons by law allowed to affirm or declare instead of swearing'.
The general concept is that every affidavit needs to be notarised by the notary appointed thereof. The Notaries Ordinance, 1961 does not define the word ""affidavit"". To notarise any instrument, the instrument is generally made in affidavit format. The function of notary is wider than notarising the affidavit only; notarising the affidavit is a part thereof. There is no contention in this Act that every affidavit should be notarised by the Notary Public. In addition, there is no such contention either in the General Clauses Act or any other Act that every affidavit is necessary to be notarised by the notary.
Now the question arises whether the affidavit as required under section 27(1) of the Nari O Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and some other criminal laws is necessary to be notarised by the Notary. In practice, affidavit is submitted with or without being notarised, and the criminal courts accept both. In this pasture, it is necessary to examine whether criminal laws require any affidavit to be notarised by the notary, or if any affidavit is submitted after notary will be nullified, or having or not-having notary carries out any material difference.
Section 539 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that affidavits and affirmations to be used before the High Court Division or any officer of such court may be sworn and affirmed before such court or the clerk of the State or any Commissioner or other person appointed by such court for that purpose, or any Judge, or any Commissioner for taking affidavits in any Court of Record in Bangladesh.
Further explanation to this provision is given under the Criminal Rules and Orders (Practice and Procedure of Subordinate Courts), 2009. Rule 17 provides that 'all petitions, petitions of appeal, affidavits and papers of similar character presented to the Court, be … dated and signed by the person presenting and where necessary, by such other person as may, by law, be required to sign them ….'.
Rules 24-32 further explain the format and requirements of affidavit. Rule 24 provides that 'every affidavit to be used in a Court shall be entitled ""In the Court of.......... at..........""' naming such court. Every affidavit shall be drawn up in the first person and divided into paragraphs numbered consecutively, and each paragraph, as nearly as may be, shall be confined to a distinct portion of the subject-matter and should be properly verified. Therefore, it is clear from the said Rule that every affidavit is required to be submitted before the criminal court in accordance with the aforesaid format addressing the court. There is no requirement for notary with the Notary Public. It must address the concerned court.
Every person other than a party in a criminal case or proceeding in which the application is made, making an affidavit, shall be described in such manner as shall serve to identify him clearly and where necessary for this purpose, the affidavit shall contain his full name, age, father's name, profession or trade and place of residence, and shall be subscribed either with a signature in his own hand or his left thumb-impression (Rule 25). Unless it be otherwise provided, an affidavit may be made by any person having cognisance of the facts deposed to, and two or more persons may join in an affidavit, but each shall depose separately to those facts, which are within his knowledge, and such facts shall be stated in separate paragraphs (Rule 26).
When the declarant in any affidavit swears to any fact within his knowledge, he must do so directly and positively using the words 'I affirm (or make oath)' and say (Rule 27). Every affidavit should clearly express how much is a statement of the declarant's knowledge and how much is a statement made on his information or to his belief and must also state the source or ground of the information or belief with sufficient particularity (Rule 28).
Every person making an affidavit, if not personally known to any Judge or Magistrate or any Commissioner of Affidavits/Oaths appointed by the High Court Division or the Court of Sessions shall be identified to such Judge, Magistrate or the Commissioner, as the case may be, by an Advocate or someone known to him and the Judge, Magistrate and the Commissioner, as the case may be, shall state at the foot of the affidavit (a) the name and description of the person identifying, and (b) the time and place of the making of the affidavit (Rule 29).
Where the declarant is a 'Pardanashin' woman, she shall be identified by a person to whom she is known and before whom she is accustomed to appear unveiled and such person shall at the foot of the affidavit certify that the declarant was identified by him and sign his name thereto and shall prove such identification by a separate affidavit (Rule 30).
The person before whom an affidavit is presented shall, before signing, be satisfied that the contents of the affidavit are known to the declarant and that it contains his signature or thumb-impression (Rule 31). Every correction in an affidavit shall be authenticated by the Judge, the Magistrate or the Commissioner of Affidavits/Oaths, as the case may be, before whom it is presented for swearing or affirmation (Rule 32).
Under the circumstances, it is clear that affidavit to be submitted before the criminal court in a criminal case must address the concerned court in the format as prescribed under the Criminal Rules and Orders. This affidavit, however, does not need to be notarised; the notarised affidavit does not debar the concerned criminal court from accepting the same if it is filed in compliance with the provisions of said Rules and Orders. The main contention is that it must fulfill the requirements provided under the Rules and the same should be accepted by the concerned court. If the same is not endorsed by the concerned court in prescribed format, then the notary of the same shall not be sufficient to validate it.

www.thedailystar.net/offbeat/news/china-trump-wax-statue-maker-laments-covid-19-fallout-1950121,Offbeat,2020-08-24T18:07:14+06:00,2020-08-24T18:07:14+06:00,"In China, a Trump wax statue maker laments Covid-19 fallout",Donald Trump is best-selling wax-statue model by Shanghai Maiyi Arts in the United States.,"For Zeng Sheng, the manager at Shanghai Maiyi Arts, this autumn should have been a boon for business: with the US presidential election, demand for the centre's wax replicas of Donald Trump should have been off the charts.
Instead, the spread of the coronavirus has halted new orders and stalled overseas travel, including to and from the United States. He is now holding off on producing a replica of Joe Biden.
""Tourist sites, amusement parks, houses of famous people are temporarily not open,"" Zeng said. ""Since they can't resume work, we can't get new orders.""
Shanghay Maiyi Arts was founded in 2012 as a manufacturer and supplier of wax figures.
Located in the outskirts of Shanghai, about an hour's drive from the city centre, its exhibition hall also doubles as makeshift museum, where guests can pose next to replicas of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, martial arts star Jackie Chan, and others.
Zeng says that by 2019, the company was shipping up to 700 figures annually to customers, with about one-third going overseas.
The virus, however, hit orders twice: first in China, when factories and tourist sites closed, and then overseas. Business remains about two-thirds its normal size, Zeng says.
Zeng says that the hardest part of making a replica is the face. It can take a month alone to design and sculpt perfect features.
The company uses specialists to make a replica's hair and clothing. It can take three months to bring a figure to fruition, from start to finish.
Although Trump is the company's best-selling model in the United States, in China, the top seller is something closer to home: a replica of a security guard, asleep and slumped in a chair, brings in the most orders.
Last year the shop produced 16 Trump wax statues, six of which went abroad."

Meanwhile, predatory international law firms are encouraging multimillion-dollar investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) lawsuits citing Covid-19 containment, relief and recovery measures.","With the Covid-19 contagion from late 2019 spreading internationally this year, governments have responded, often in desperation. Meanwhile, predatory international law firms are encouraging multimillion-dollar investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) lawsuits citing Covid-19 containment, relief and recovery measures.
 
Most governments failed to introduce sufficient precautionary measures early enough to prevent Covid-19 contagions from spreading. And when they did act, they often believed they had little choice but to impose nationwide ""stay in shelter"" lockdowns to enforce preventive physical distancing.
To enable businesses and households to survive the adverse effects of such lockdowns, governments have provided relief measures, for at least some of those believed to have been adversely affected, especially for businesses better able to lobby effectively.
Meanwhile, there are already thousands of mainly bilateral investment treaties as well as bilateral and plurilateral trade agreements worldwide, enabling foreign investors to sue governments before private arbitration tribunals to profit from their wide-ranging treaty rights.
Transnational corporations (TNCs) can claim staggering sums in damages for alleged investment losses, for either alleged expropriation, or more typically, indirect ""damage"" caused by regulatory changes, in this case, Covid-19 government response measures.
As some such measures try to share the burden of the crisis, e.g., with asset owners and other contracting parties, the international law firm Shearman & Sterling advises financial firms, ""While helping debtors, these measures would inevitably impact creditors by causing loss of income"", referring to debt relief and restructuring efforts among others.
Foreign registered real estate or property companies can also sue governments that protect lessees or tenants who cannot make their lease or rent payments as contractually scheduled after their operations are shut down or disrupted by emergency regulations imposed.
Pharmaceutical and medical supplies companies can also appeal to such arbitration tribunals to claim losses due to price controls and ""violated"" intellectual property rights for Covid-19 tests, treatments, medical and protective equipment as well as vaccines.
 
In recent months, international law firms have been encouraging ISDS lawsuits citing government measures to check contagion and mitigate their economic consequences, urging clients to invoke investment and trade agreements to claim for allegedly lost income or additional losses or costs due to new government policy measures.
Another firm Ropes & Gray advises: ""Governments have responded to COVID-19 with a panoply of measures, including…limitations on business operations, and tax benefits. Notwithstanding their legitimacy, these measures can negatively impact businesses by reducing profitability, delaying operations or being excluded from government benefits…For companies with foreign investments, investment agreements could be a powerful tool to recover or prevent loss resulting from COVID-19 related government actions.""
Shearman & Sterling advises, ""Some interventions will be protectionist—they will seek to support or benefit domestic enterprises (strategic or otherwise) but not foreign investors"", without mentioning their generally far lower tax contributions and generous investment incentives enjoyed.
 
After advising clients to look out for discriminatory measures which could become the bases for such claims, law firm Sidley warns governments that proceedings can be very costly as ""it is not only the actually invested amounts that can be considered recoverable damages, but also lost future profits"".
Such law firms remind their clientele that many of the more than thousand ISDS lawsuits filed worldwide have arisen during political or economic crises. Covid-19 pandemic response measures are now being widely studied as possible pretexts for another round of lawsuits.
These corporate lawsuits can impose massive fiscal burdens on governments. As Pia Eberhardt shows, legal costs average well over USD 6 million per party, but can be much higher. Hence, such suits can drain government fiscal resources.
Although it becomes much more expensive if governments lose, they still have to cover their own legal expenses even if they do not lose. As of 2018, governments had been ordered to pay USD 88 billion for settlements made public.
There is considerable scope for such cases given the still growing, broad range of government Covid-19 measures, e.g., foreign-owned water supply companies can sue governments for insisting that more public water supply sources be provided, or household water supplies remain uninterrupted, even if water bills are not settled, to enable more regular hand washing.
 
International investment law is generally independent of national legislatures and biased toward TNC interests. Investment agreements prescribe foreign investor rights and privileges very broadly, but their duties and obligations, usually rather minimally.
Sovereign national societies, parliaments and governments have considerable scope for discretion in addressing complex political issues involving diverse social and economic interests. Also, national courts generally do not award damages for lost future profits as these are considered completely conjectural.
But ISDS provides much more favourable treatment to powerful TNCs. Also, international arbitration tribunals ignore and undermine the legitimate scope for national courts, law-making and democratic government decision-making.
The typically transnational arbitration tribunals that interpret such law generally ignore recent legal developments, which take more account of the rights and responsibilities of various other stakeholders in national societies. Thus, arbitration awards tend to be much more lucrative, for both TNCs and their lawyers, than ordinary national court decisions.
A South Centre Southview urges considering various measures in response to the threat such as terminating or suspending investment treaties, withdrawing consent to arbitration, statutorily prohibiting recourse to arbitration and appealing to TNCs' corporate moral responsibility
Already, there are growing appeals for an immediate moratorium on ISDS lawsuits and to end ISDS proceedings involving Covid-19 emergency measures, while some countries, e.g., India, South Africa and Indonesia, had scrapped some of their bilateral investment treaties even before the crisis.
The Southview opinion also chides the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) for trifling with marginal reforms, instead of radically reconsidering the very illegitimacy of international investment arbitration itself.
As the world struggles to cope with an unprecedented ""black swan"" public health threat, the prospect of a world recession taking the planet into depression is greater than ever in the last eight decades. The need to end ISDS provisions and lawsuits is more urgent than ever.

www.thedailystar.net/opinion/rmg-notes/news/supplier-crisis-shows-why-retailer-bankruptcy-laws-need-reform-1949701,"Opinion, RMG NOTES",2020-08-24T00:00:00+06:00,2020-08-24T00:00:00+06:00,Supplier crisis shows why retailer bankruptcy laws need reform,"Running a business is a hard slog. It involves long hours, lots of stress, lots of responsibility and rarely a time to switch off and relax. I am not complaining—that is the life I have chosen, and I feel blessed I have been given the privilege to run my own company.","Running a business is a hard slog. It involves long hours, lots of stress, lots of responsibility and rarely a time to switch off and relax. I am not complaining—that is the life I have chosen, and I feel blessed I have been given the privilege to run my own company.
It seems, however, that we are not playing on an even playing field in the global apparel industry. Allow me to explain. Much of the stress I suffer is because I have responsibilities, and I take them very seriously. I have staff to pay and I feel a great responsibility for them. I also have suppliers to pay and I feel a huge burden and debt and gratitude towards them. These are my worries—being fair, and ethical.
Not all businesses operate by this rulebook. In fact, many of the brands and retailers that operate in the global apparel space seem to have completely torn it up. In the past few years, we have seen several major apparel retailers go bust. The US apparel brand J.Crew Group Inc. filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy court protection. Another US apparel retailer JC Penney could file for bankruptcy, according to media reports. What does this mean? Essentially, they are losing money—their outgoings are greater than their income. There is no shame in that, and I have sympathy for such companies.
It is what happens next that is the issue.
If the above was my company, if I was losing money, I would do one of two things. I would seek to cut my costs; and I would seek to increase my revenues. And if I could not achieve one or either of those things, I might have to accept that I wasn't a very good businessperson—and close my operations.
Yet failure does not seem to be an option for many western retailers and department stores. In recent years we have seen the likes of Sears Corp, Debenhams, Peacocks and Forever 21 in administration or undergoing restructuring. Why? Because they were not making money.
They restructure and in that process a lot of their debts with suppliers—yes, that's people like me—are written off. Then they return and the whole process starts again.
Several questions arise from this. Firstly, if these businesses were failing the first-time round, why are they starting again? Does that failure not send a message to those involved? Why are these businesses being purchased again? Is it because there is a genuine market need for them? Or is it because those private equity businesses involved—and it is nearly always private equity—see a chance to make a fast buck?
In the UK they have a thing called a pre-pack administration. Several retailers have been through pre-pack administrations and my own research on this shows that the companies which arise out of them—the reborn companies which come out of administration—have a very poor track record.
Peacocks has been in administration before and is likely to enter it again. Peacocks owes my own business a six-figure sum. Will I ever see this money? It is highly unlikely.
How many suppliers—creditors—will Peacocks take down with it? If Debenhams goes into administration, how many creditors will fall with it? And what about Forever 21 and JC Penney?
There has to be a better way than this. I understand the issue of bankruptcy and I appreciate that we have to create a climate where businesspeople are prepared to take risk. But there is a huge difference between genuine entrepreneurialism and risk taking and rank opportunism or people ""playing the system"".
As I said earlier, being in business is very risky as a supplier. But the directors of many of these retailers seem to be playing by a different set of rules. It is a case of heads you win, tails... you also win. Failure never happens because even if the business is failing, they simply wipe the slate clean and start again. This is a parallel world which few—if any—of my fellow suppliers would understand.
Is there a solution? Laws in the west will not change on these issues—that much has become clear in recent years. Therefore, the answer lies with us as suppliers. We cannot keep giving credit to what I will term ""zombie"" companies—retailers that have been in administration or through a restructuring. Tighten their payment terms or make them pay half up front, half later. If we give them credit there is a very good chance we may not see it again, so just don't take the risk.
All of us collectively as suppliers need to think about these issues, now and beyond Covid-19. It's all well and good getting business and orders in, but these orders are useless if we don't end up getting paid for them and they potentially take our business down.
This is the playing field we are in these days—a field where different rules apply and where, for many of our customers, failure is never allowed to happen. We have to behave accordingly and take strong steps to protect our livelihoods in future.

This is distressing and frustrating in view of the fact that during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the performance of our police, particularly their public-spiritedness and proactive stance, earned the organisation well-deserved plaudits. Sadly, public appreciation has been overtaken by public anger.
As the image of the police reflected by the mirror of public opinion conforms to what the police and the police culture are, both the image and culture are in danger of substantial damage. This is disappointing because there is no dearth of right-thinking, right-doing, courageous and conscientious policemen. Citations of police medals highlight the glowing performances of such personnel; and for every one recorded, many other instances of courage pass unnoticed. The point to note is that timely and just action taken by upright policemen on many occasions cannot wash out one of those image-shattering misdeeds.
On ground, the good work done by police over the years pales into insignificance in the face of their illegal action and unbecoming conduct which really hurts the susceptibilities of the people. There are indeed few jobs as demanding as that of a policeman. This perhaps explains why misconduct of the police severely pinches, irks, annoys and angers the people and has a lasting tarnishing effect on the public image of the police. When members of other profession fall from the pedestal of public respect, citizens may dismiss this fall as one of the frailties of human nature. In the case of policemen it usually makes the headline even if it is the most routine of human frailties.
A poignant saying in criminal law enforcement parlance states that no two days are similar for lawmen and that the sweet taste of appreciation is comparatively rare to them than the bitterness of the complaint. One has to agree that policing is an unpleasant coercive job where experience shows that retaining a good image is indeed a difficult achievement. Such an observation should not be construed as one of defending the misdeeds of deviant policemen.
For any discerning observer, it would only be logical to infer that the image crisis has not happened all of a sudden. Broadly speaking, it needs to be ascertained if organisational goals and operational imperatives have facilitated and encouraged deviant policing. Are policemen indulging in doing things which they ought not to do or refraining from doing things they ought to do to favour people in powerful positions? Do the policemen need such powerful people to obtain choice postings, to avoid being transferred, to mitigate disciplinary measures or to earn an advancement in rank? Is there a necessary basis providing for a mutually advantageous barter?
The above apprehension surfaces because the superintendence and control over the police rests in the executive branch of the government. To ask a specific question, did law and order and crime situation including drug trafficking in Teknaf Police Station assume serious proportion warranting deployment of lawless officials? Scores of the so-called encounter deaths reported in the media pertaining to this area point to such a premonition. Are our guardians desperate for short-term, spectacular results even though they may be illusory?
To state the obvious, police officers are sworn to uphold the law. They are presumed to have no other duty and to have no right to enforce laws selectively. The policemen who fail to do his duty or misuses his position is guilty of violating the trust of those who employ him—the public. The enforcers of law must not be allowed to violate the law, even to catch criminals. If they are allowed to resort to dirty methods they make the law dirty.
If a government becomes lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law. To declare that the government may commit crimes to secure convictions of criminals would bring terrible retribution. For the interest of the government is not that it should win cases but that justice shall be done. Law is the means and justice is the end. A democratic society should be constrained to sacrifice police effectiveness at the altar of civil liberty as that is the desirable mode.
It would not be fair to put all the blame on the political class because there are allegations that at times police officers have implicitly proclaimed political expediency to justify extra legal actions. Are the public and the police caught in an increasingly norm-free, unpredictable and unjust environment? A fear is that a kind of Gresham's Law may have started to work wherein intrusion of extraneous interest in matters of police management has led to solicitation of further political influence. In such an eventuality, the inevitable result would be pervasive disillusionment, loss of pride and collegiality. Furthermore, in such a state, policing would be transformed from the professional imposition of a coherent moral consensus on society into myopic group activity.
The issue of image crisis cannot be appreciated in isolation. The basic features of our republican constitution, parliamentary democracy and development administration are in conflict with the inherited political organisational characteristics of the administrative structure. Therefore, without organisational renewal and revitalisation and the nurturing of professional skills, the police image would more often than not run the risk of being smeared.

Issuing a statement on the eve of the 3rd year of the Rohingya influx, the forum said the political processes for the dignified repatriation of the Myanmar nationals who fled persecution should be prioritised.
Before their successful repatriation, the authorities concerned should facilitate ""localisation"" of the refugees and ensure transparency in aid management, said the forum, a network of 50 local and national NGOs working in Cox's Bazar.
CCNF reiterated its demands for all-out efforts from the United Nations, international NGOs, and the government to expedite the process of dignified repatriation of the Rohingyas.
If the repatriation of 1.1 million Rohingya refugees start tomorrow, it will take over one decade, said the forum.
""So, they should not be kept sitting idle, they should be given pre-fabricated shelter, education and income-generation training to facilitate their human dignity,"" it added.
In its 11-point demands, CCNF said there should be a government-led ""single line and single pot"" fund management, while UN agencies should act as a counterpart to government management, not in parallel.
All sub-offices of international agencies should be shifted to Dhaka or Ukhiya to reduce the cost of journeys to camps and to reduce pressure on Cox's Bazar town, the forum said.
It said humanitarian workers should be given 24 hour access to refugee camps so that they can initiate activities against drug dealing, human trafficking, gender violence, and extremism in the camps after dark.
There should be aid transparency and public monitoring on management cost as well as direct input cost to refugees and host communities, it added.
Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, executive director of COAST and a co-chair of CCNF, said local NGOs, community organisations and local government authorities in Cox's Bazar are committed to uphold the dignity and rights of the Rohingya until their repatriation.
He said the local NGOs and local government organisations have to be given space in response management."

Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Farhtheeba Rahat Khan, Team Leader, RMG Inclusive Business Programs, SNV Netherlands Development Organisation 
Access to general and reproductive health services is just as important as protecting our garment workers from the impact of COVID-19. Health insurance is essential, and there are pilots on insurance in the garment sector. There is an immediate need for a long-stretching vision of preparedness and collaborative approach to culminate the learnings and come up with a standardised framework to ensure health, SRHR and gender issues for RMG workers.
Mahfuz Anam, Editor and Publisher, The Daily Star
I want to assure you that we will highlight the issues at stake that need to be brought to the attention of the policymakers. We will research, report and try to shed some light on the issues. We will try to focus on the solutions to these issues and play the necessary role at the right time, to speed up the process and stay committed to our female workers in the garments sector.
Dr Syed Abdul Hamid, Professor and Director, Institute of Health Economics, University of Dhaka
The RMG sector contributes 84 percent of export earnings in the country. In more than 4,000 factories out of the 5.1 million workers, the majority is women (around 65 percent). A large portion of these females are at the peak of their reproductive health (age 18-32). Workers are often affected by sexual and reproductive diseases and issues like poor hygienic conditions and they are often unable to manage their menstrual health properly. We performed a rapid small-scale survey and interviewed 237 workers in 22 factories. Since this is a very small survey, we can surely find some indications rather than definitive conclusions.
We found that 4.23 percent of the female workers experienced reproductive health problems during the past few months. 82 percent of the workers who sought healthcare took the service from the factory medical centre due to the closure of healthcare services outside. The non-COVID patients are unable to get treatment now at public hospitals because they require the COVID-19 report of the patient before providing any treatment. Workers' monthly income has also dropped significantly. In some factories, SNV insurance-based health services are available. If the government's support in terms of providing free medicines under the DG Health Services is extended to BGMEA and BKMEA hospitals and clinics, the garments workers will benefit immensely.
If we cannot bring back the healthcare situation to normal, many pregnant workers will not receive ANC and other services. We need to ensure that skilled birth attendants are present when deliveries are taking place inside homes – which is a big challenge now. This problem can be solved if the private sector ensures all their medical professionals (full-time employees) are employed. Besides, nutritional deficiency has also increased, causing health hazards.
We need to find a way to make the Ministry of Labour and Employment's central fund accessible to introduce health insurance for the RMG workers. We also need to address increased gender-based violence.
Robust research in the RMG sector is needed so that the workers' problems can be presented as evidence to bring changes in the policy.

Ubaidur Rob, Senior Associate and Country Director, The Population Council's office in Bangladesh
Replicating the structure of the community-based approach in rural areas and applying it to these factories can provide the workers with affordable medicine and other health-related facilities. We need to develop a uniform service delivery model, which SNV is trying to do. We also need to bring in BGMEA into the plan to standardise the procedure and provide reproductive health services as well, to find a systematic financing mechanism.
Dr Mohammad Mainul Islam, Professor and Chairman, Department of Population Sciences, University of Dhaka
The positive aspect of the whole situation is that we have not been infected in huge numbers as we had assumed. However, the risk of reproductive health has increased. If we can ensure the reproductive health services of the workers, we can keep progressing with a productive labour force and in that context, the workers' rights will also be preserved. We have an opportunity to research and work on a wide range of issues related to the accessibility of healthcare services.
Md Kawsar Ali, Chief Operating Officer, Comfit Composite Knit. Ltd 
During the lockdown workers were scared to seek medical services. Now we have entered the new normal stage. We have embraced the precautions for COVID-19 while working. We have also been successful in ensuring sanitary pad supplies and distributing contraceptives and birth control pills. However, we have been a little helpless during the pandemic due to a lack of support.
Dr Dabir Uddin Ahmed, Chief Executive Officer, Centre for Women and Child Health
From January to July, we provided our services to 134 male and 303 female workers and successfully continued all our vaccination services although other organisations in the area had ceased their operations. As a result, the entire burden fell on us. The government alone will not be able to bring any change. The public must be more socially conscious to counteract this.
Geetha Powani, Head of CSR, Alpha Clothing Ltd.
Female workers in our area are highly disadvantaged in the sense that there are no proper medical facilities available to them. During this lockdown, around 23 of our female workers were scheduled to give birth. Although most of these deliveries went well, there were still a few who were refused treatment by doctors. There is a lack of vaccination and proper healthcare; a child died after birth due to pneumonia. We require support from both the government and the private sector in bringing us affordable medical care that is within our reach.
Jordane Cathala, Chairman, C&R Sweater Ltd.
The workers' health is our priority. Therefore, both men and women in our factory have equal access to healthcare facilities. When our factory was built, we had ensured equal access to washrooms for all our workers. We also have sanitary napkins readily available at a subsidised cost. Lastly, various training programmes are provided to workers employed at every level.
Shammin Sultana, Programme Officer, Gender Mainstreaming, Ready-Made Garment Sector Programme, ILO
Women's representation in the RMG sector is declining (about 60.5 percent) whereas the female workers' access to healthcare facilities had already been a matter of concern. Now COVID-19 has truly affected them in a different manner. We want to relate this issue of gender-based violence and harassment with domestic violence during this pandemic and we must find ways to keep working on such women's issues and come up with solutions.
Dr Md Mostafizur Rahman Mian, Director, PMK Hospital & Diagnostic Centre
Most RMG workers lack proper nutrition and they tend to work overtime to make ends meet. We have already sought permission from the Ministry of Health to establish our nursing institute and college. We will be training nurses and midwives soon, who will be providing quality services in the surrounding RMG factories. We also need to be more proactive to reduce the impact of violence against women.
Syful Alam Mallick, Compliance Manager, South Asia, Auchan Retail International
Health and safety is a big issue in social compliance. The sexual and reproductive health of the RMG workers is also a part of this compliance. We have provided health insurance to 25,000 workers through our CSR funds. There is a severe lack of health insurance among the four million RMG workers we have and therefore more efforts are required by companies to cater to a higher number of RMG workers. We can accumulate the buyers' CSR funds and bring all the factories under insurance coverage. Also, a part of the government's central fund mentions health insurance that we need to activate. After all, how can we provide better facilities without ensuring the basic ones?
Sk Mojibul Huq, Programme Manager, Urban Development Programme, BRAC
The number of patients visiting our health centres per day has significantly declined to 15-20 from 100-120 during this pandemic. Though the centres are near the factories, workers could not visit as factories were closed at the beginning of the pandemic, and now they are unable to come due to increased workload. Policy decisions are required to provide 100 percent health insurance to RMG workers. Collaboration between ministries should increase as well.
Maheen Sultan, Lead Researcher, Centre for Gender and Social Transformation, BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD)
There are factories for local production which don't fall under compliance or buyer monitoring and the situation is more difficult here. With issues such as fear of losing jobs and excess workload, female workers are fearful of complaining against any occurrence of sexual violence. We need to provide different sorts of protection in such cases.
Md Azmal Hossain, Programme Analyst-Urban Health, UNFPA Bangladesh
The RMG sector is an excellent platform to ensure women's empowerment since it gives underprivileged women the opportunity to earn. However, the decreasing percentage of female workers leads us to ponder if we are being unable to provide a proper environment for them. We need to create a comprehensive SRHR strategy for the RMG workers to determine the roles of different stakeholders. We must focus on working towards mental health (including postpartum depression) as well since it has deteriorated during this pandemic.
Mushfiqua Zaman Satiar, Senior Policy Adviser, SRHR and Gender, Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands
We need to take a holistic approach. The shadow pandemic – Violence Against Women (VAW) – that we are seeing now is becoming increasingly critical. The Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands strongly emphasises on collaborating with multiple stakeholders. The Embassy will continue to provide policy level involvement and support on SRHR issues even though we are gradually phasing out of programming and moving towards trade from aid. We have to work together to minimise the impact of this pandemic and I believe, our combined approach will lead the RMG sector to enhance the country's GDP.
Hanifur Rahman, Chairman, BGMEA Standing Committee on Health Centers, BGMEA
Each year, we spend 3.5 to 4 crore taka on this sector to provide medicine and other facilities free of charge through BGMEA health centres.  There should be more focus on menstrual hygiene and health since this affects both the physical and mental health of workers and is still a taboo in our country. We are working with the University of Dhaka to produce a guideline that ensures maximum nutritional value for RMG workers at a minimum cost.
Dr Md Sarwar Bari, Director (Finance) and Line Director, FP-FSDP, DGFP Directorate General of Family Planning
We signed an MoU with BGMEA and BKMEA under which we are providing training to factories. Family planning commodities are supplied for free to those who are trained to provide family planning services at garment factories. We have set up experimental satellite clinics, especially in the garment factories of Narayanganj. Moreover, national health insurance is required in our country. If that is not possible, then small-scale health insurance coverage should be expanded.
Dr Mollah Jalal Uddin, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Labour & Employment
At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the DIFE along with ILO created a guideline with clear roles of the factory owners, workers, and the government. We have undertaken a massive project to overcome manpower shortage and will create nearly 1,514 new inspector positions. This will strengthen our monitoring system. The service quality and overall scenario of the RMG sector have improved drastically. However, there is scope for further improvement."

Barca's statement said Pjanic, 30, tested positive on Saturday after feeling unwell and that he was isolating at home but in good health and would not be able to travel to join up with his team mates for a period of 15 days.
The Bosnia midfielder, who is yet to be officially presented as a Barca player, joined the club from Juventus in June for 60 million euros ($70.75 million) in a move which saw Arthur Melo going the other way for 72 million.
Barca's first team players have been on holiday since losing 8-2 to Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-finals nine days ago but resume training on Aug. 31.
Pjanic won't be able to begin training until Sept. 7, less than a week before the new season starts.
Barca, however, will not start their Liga campaign until the third week of the season due to their participation in the final phase of the Champions League."

Bangladesh's former ODI captain Mashrafe however said in a Facebook post that he is having a difficult time coming to terms with Bayern's win.
Mash is an avid Argentina supporter and Germany had thwarted Lionel Messi's Argentina at the World Cup in more than one occasion. Growing up, Mash had been a huge fan of Diego Maradona, who had also been thwarted by Germany in 1990 World Cup.
Mash perhaps was reminded of Germany's World Cup win in 2014, when they clinched the trophy by beating Argentina 1-0 in the final.
Mashrafe expressed his disappointment in social media following Bayern's win. ""The good and bad feelings I am going through after a match…
""1. As an Argentina supporter, I didn't feel bad after Di Maria's defeat.
2. Argentina bowed from the World Cup to Mbappe's pace so didn't feel bad about him losing.
3. Can't cope with Lewandowski or Muller's celebrations.
4.Though I am not a Brazil supporter, I am feeling anxious for Neymar. If he got the trophy it would have been better.
5. In the end I deciphered the main reason I can't accept any win by a Germany team. It's because Argentina always come up short against them."""

On Sunday night, the 24-year-old Bayern Munich star scored the only goal that condemned his former side PSG -- a club he has been with since he was eight -- to defeat in the Champions League final.
When Kingsley Coman stepped off the bench to make his Paris Saint-Germain debut in February 2013, some may have believed they were witnessing the emergence of a player who could help lead the French outfit to the European success they craved.
Then the Qatar project came in but Coman, who made just two further league appearances for PSG, departed for Juventus in the summer of 2014. He then moved to Bayern in 2015-16 before completing the move permanently in 2017.
Yesterday was the most important night in PSG's history but their former star in Coman, who was not banked upon, poured cold water on their continental dreams.
One way to describe the scene would be: A man from Paris, who played for Paris, whose father supported Paris, scores goal that stops Paris winning a first ever European Cup that was also invented in Paris.
860 million was spent in the last 8 years by the Qatar project but PSG's most important player had his say by scoring the goal that mattered, unfortunately he did it for Bayern. Not deemed good enough to play with the likes of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, Coman provided poetic justice and a telling blow.
Having won the Champions league, he described it as 'extraordinary, a great joy'. ""I feel a bit sad for Paris. They've had an extraordinary journey. We must respect what Paris have done.
""We tried to put a lot of pressure on them. We didn't concede a goal, that's the most important thing. It was a great final.""
Coman, who had also missed out on France's winning 2018 World Cup run through injury, was not even expected to be in the starting lineup against PSG.
A surprise change by coach Hansi Flick brought the speedy Frenchman in for Ivan Perisic, with Coman on a good day strong in one-on-one situations and quicker than the Croatian down the wing.
The coach's move proved a masterstroke as Coman, lurking at the far post, beat defender Thilo Kehrer and headed in a Joshua Kimmich cross for the winner in the 59th minute."

Bayern beat Paris St Germain 1-0 courtesy of Kingsley Coman's 59th minute winner to claim their third trophy of the season following their Bundesliga and German Cup double and complete an amazing transformation.
""I am proud of this team,"" a beaming Flick told reporters. ""When I started in November I read the headlines: 'No need to fear or respect Bayern Munich anymore', 'The team is awful.""
""But the development of my team since then has been sensational. We made maximum use of everything. It is not easy to win three titles. It was hard work,"" he added.
Flick replaced Niko Kovac in November after a 5-1 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt and with Bayern having dropped out of the top three in the Bundesliga.
But the former Germany assistant coach almost instantly turned the campaign on its head, leading Bayern to an unbeaten 2020 in every competition.
They have won 21 consecutive matches in all competitions and are on a 30-game unbeaten run despite a two-month break in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Flick reinstalled Thomas Mueller in attack behind Robert Lewandowski and also plucked Jerome Boateng from the bench to restore order in the German side's defence.
""You could see during winter how much determination we have in this team, which is obviously something you wish for as a coach,"" Flick said. ""The team is eager and we have players with boundless desire to win.""
""The only thing that was missing was the fans. Maybe in the future we can have games with fans again. This sport deserves it.""
The eight-team Champions League tournament was played in Lisbon in empty stadiums due to the pandemic.
The Bavarians won every Champions League game this season - including a memorable 8-2 demolition of Barcelona in the quarter-finals - becoming the first side to do so.
""The team is always in the foreground,"" Flick said. ""When you see how we worked until the 96th minute tonight in defence then it is a superb team spirit.
""Every player developed this season in such a way so as to win three titles. This only happens as a team."""

Here's our round-up of the most exciting reveals from DC's global online experience.
WONDER WOMAN 1984
First off DC showed a new trailer for Wonder Woman 1984. The trailer included a full reveal of one of Wonder Woman's most iconic villains, Cheetah, in her complete humanoid-cheetah look. Diana of Themyscira will be back on the big screen on October 2nd, 2020.
BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHTS

DC finally revealed the trailer of Batman: Gotham Knights scheduled for 2021 after about a year of teases regarding the next Batman game. And what's most shocking about it is that Batman is apparently dead. The game includes Nightwing, Red Hood, Batgirl and Tim Drake Robin as the playable characters. The trailer also teases the Court of Owls being involved and the Bat-Family has a serious challenge ahead of them. Gotham Knights is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, and will be playable solo or in co-op.
THE FLASH MOVIE
DC officially confirmed that the Flash movie will be based on the critically acclaimed Flashpoint storyline and will feature crossovers. Official concept arts give us the first look of Ezra Miller's new Flash suit which is going to be designed by Batman. Previously, Ben Affleck was confirmed to reprise his role as Batman in the Flash movie.
JAMES GUNN'S SUICIDE SQUAD

Fandome showcased an absolutely crazy first look at James Gunn's The Suicide Squad movie and also featured character introductions. Apart from the returning roles of Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, the cast includes Idris Elba as Bloodsport, John Cena as Peace Maker and others.
SUICIDE SQUAD: KILL THE JUSTICE LEAGUE GAME

Rocksteady and DC have a new game coming called Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and boy, it looks amazing! The first look trailer shows Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot and King Shark getting ready to confront a bloodthirsty Superman and the game is scheduled for 2022 on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.
JUSTICE LEAGUE SNYDER CUT
Justice League #TheSnyderCut has a trailer now and after months of teases from Zack Snyder himself, it has been confirmed that this version of the story will be divided into 4 hour-long episodes. The trailer features Darkseid, a more menacing Steppenwolf and a whole lot of new scenes.
THE BATMAN

As you probably already know, DC dropped the trailer for The Batman and the internet has broken loose. Fans are hyped to see Robert Pattinson's Batman and the trailer gives a whole lot to look forward to. As it has already been revealed, the story will take heavy inspirations from the Long Halloween comic. Batman hasn't been in the crime-fighting business for long and is already swarmed by the Penguin, the Riddler, Catwoman, the Joker and most likely a few others. A prequel series is also in development for HBO Max.

The filing came in a dispute between Apple and Epic Games. Apple removed Epic's titles from its App Store after the game maker violated the iPhone maker's in-app payment rules.
Epic says that Apple has also threatened to cut off its access to Apple tools needed to maintain ""Unreal Engine,"" software that many game developers license to create better graphics. Microsoft said the move would hurt at least one of its own game titles called ""Forza Street"" that uses the engine for the iOS version of the game.
Kevin Gammill, Microsoft's general manager of gaming developer experiences, said Microsoft has an ""enterprise-wide"" license to Unreal Engine and that Apple's move would hamper it and other gaming firms' ability to make games with the technology for Macs and iPhones. ""If Unreal Engine cannot support games for iOS or macOS, Microsoft would be required to choose between abandoning its customers and potential customers on the iOS and macOS platforms or choosing a different game engine when preparing to develop new games,"" Gammill wrote.
Nicholas Penwarden, Epic's vice president of engineering, said in a filing on Sunday that multiple Unreal Engine users - including at least one automotive design firm - have contacted the company with worries their projects will be disrupted.
Epic is seeking a court order to stop Apple's termination of its developer accounts. Apple has said that it will reverse its moves if Epic resubmits a version of ""Fortnite"" that complies with its payment rules.
On Friday, Apple said in a filing that Epic unilaterally decided to break its rules after following them for more than a decade, calling Epic's removal from the App Store a ""self-inflicted wound."""

Under a heading titled ""Do not travel to Bangladesh"", the advisory said, ""Travellers to Bangladesh may experience border closures, airport closures, travel prohibitions, quarantine requirements, stay at home orders, business closures, or other emergency conditions within Bangladesh due to Covid-19.""
The US State Department, in the travel advisory updated on August 6, 2020, also urged its citizens to exercise increased caution in the country due to crime, terrorism, and kidnapping.
Among other Asian countries, India, China, Bhutan were also issued Level-4 travel advisory by the US State Department, while Level-3 advisory has been issued for Nepal, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
There are four advisory levels from low to high risk. According to US State Department website, level 1 is blue (exercise normal precautions), level 2 is yellow (exercise increased caution), level 3 is orange (reconsider travel) and level 4 is red (do not travel).
""In Bangladesh the crime rate impacting foreigners is generally low. However, travellers should be aware of petty crimes such as pickpocketing in crowded areas,"" the advisory said.
""Crimes such as muggings, burglaries, assaults, and illegal drug trafficking constitute the majority of criminal activity in Bangladesh's major cities, but there are no indications foreigners are being targeted because of their nationality. These crimes tend to be situational, based on time and location,"" it read.
""Terrorism events can happen with little or no warning, with terrorists targeting public areas such as tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, restaurants, places of worship, school campuses, and government facilities,"" the state department warned.
The state department also said the US government employees in Bangladesh are subject to movement and travel restrictions because of security concerns.
""The US government may have limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in Bangladesh due to these travel restrictions, a lack of infrastructure, and limited host government emergency response resources,"" the advisory also read.
The US State Department urged its citizens to reconsider any plan to travel to southeast Bangladesh, including the Chattogram Hill Tracts region, citing crime, terrorism, and kidnapping.
""Travel is dangerous to the Khagrachari, Rangamati, and Bandarban Hill Tracts districts (collectively known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts) due to occasional communal violence and other security risks,"" it said.
""Prior approval from the Government of Bangladesh Ministry of Home Affairs Office of Public Safety is required if you plan to travel to these areas,"" the advisory added.
The US State Department also suggested the citizens to visit its website and consult the country information page in the case they decide to travel to Bangladesh:
It advised the US citizens to see the US Embassy's web page regarding Covid-19 and visit the webpage Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on travel and Covid-19.
The State Department further advised the US citizens to: avoid demonstrations and political gatherings; not physically resist any robbery attempt; get to a safe area and report any criminal incident to local authorities; enrol in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive alerts and so it is easier to be located in an emergency; follow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter; review the Crime and Safety Report for Bangladesh; always have a contingency plan for emergency situations; and to review the Traveller's Checklist."

","At least 13 young people suffocated in a crush during a raid on a nightclub in Peru's capital, where a party was being held in violation of a coronavirus ban on large gatherings, police and press reports said.
""After a police operation in a discotheque in the Los Olivos neighborhood, 13 people have died,"" Peruvian police chief General Orlando Velasco told RPP radio.
Twenty-three people were arrested for taking part in what health officials said could be a mass-spreader event; 15 of them later tested positive for the coronavirus, police said.
Latin America has been badly hit by the pandemic, and Peruvian officials this month reimposed stricter curbs on movement and large gatherings.
Peru is the third-hardest-hit country in the region -- after Brazil and Mexico -- registering 27,453 deaths from the virus since March.
 -Police tactics disputed -
The illegal birthday party on Saturday was organized on social media and drew a crowd of around 120, most of them in their 20s or 30s, to a licensed nightclub called the Thomas Restobar, the interior ministry said in a statement.
""Faced with the police operation, which did not use any type of weapon or tear gas, those attending the party tried to escape through the single exit, trampling each other and getting trapped in the stairway,"" the ministry said.
The police action, an hour before a nighttime curfew was to take effect, was triggered when neighbors called police to complain about the illegal gathering.
However, some who were at the party or who live near the nightclub disputed the ministry's version of events.
""It appears that police entered and threw tear gas canisters at them, and boxed them in,"" one local resident told RPP.
- No money for a burial -
The dead included 12 women and one man, according to Women's Minister Rosario Sasieta, who traveled to the scene before visiting with survivors in a hospital.
""It should never have happened. We are in a pandemic, in a health emergency. I am calling for the maximum punishment possible for the nightclub owners,"" she told RPP.
Peruvian law calls for fines of about $110 and potential jail sentences for those who violate the virus-related restrictions.
Family members traveled to the Lima morgue to identify their loved ones.
""I found out that my daughter died, asphyxiated, this morning,"" Gregoria Velasquez, mother of 26-year-old Maryori Salcedo Velasquez, told the America Television channel. ""I don't have money to bury her.""
Another devastated young woman, who did not give her name, told reporters: ""If I'm still alive, God knows why. My partner who was with me died in my arms.""
Six people, including three police officers and three civilians, were injured, the interior ministry said.
It said authorities are trying to identify the party organizers and the owners of the club.
Witnesses said the incident began when police officers entered the club and ordered women to leave first.
Panic ensued when several men, fearing arrest, rushed toward a lone exit door, trampling several women blocked near the exit.
Peru, with a population of 33 million, has recorded 585,000 coronavirus cases. This month the country reimposed a Sunday curfew in response to the rising number of infections.
A nighttime curfew has been in place since March 16 while the borders are closed and school classes have been suspended for the rest of the year."

Sonia handed over a note expressing her desire to step down as party chief to the party's senior leader KC Venugopal, sources said.
In the note read out at a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) in New Delhi, 73-year-old Sonia called for a start of the process to select a new party chief, the sources said.
Sonia's desire to resign as the party's interim chief came with reference to a letter by the senior leaders including Ghulam Nabi Azad, Shashi Tharoor, Anand Sharma and Kapil Sibal, our New Delhi correspondent reports.
The senior leaders went to the extent of questioning the current CWC's ability to guide the party in the fight against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Ironically, at least three of the leaders are part of the CWC -- Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma and Mukul Wasnik.
The 20 pro-leadership change leaders also said the Congress has failed to conduct an honest introspection of its losses in 2014 and 2019 parliamentary polls and that the uncertainty over leadership has demoralised party workers.
Ahead of today's meeting, several Congress chief ministers led the calls for Sonia to stay on until Rahul Gandhi takes charge.
Almost all Lok Sabha lawmakers of the party have written to Sonia expressing solidarity and urging her to continue in her post or install Rahul Gandhi.
The Congress is clearly divided on the leadership issue with a section demanding collective leadership and another reposing faith in the Gandhi family.
The 20 party leaders wrote to Sonia demanding a full-time, visible president and overhauling of the organisational structure including elections to the CWC and reconstitution of the party's parliamentary board.
This is the second challenge to Sonia Gandhi's leadership after the one in 1999 when the then leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Sharad Pawar had questioned it for her Italian origin in order to keep her from being named the party's prime ministerial face in the general elections that year.
Sonia had resigned from the CWC in 1999 but the party's highest decision-making forum unanimously rejected her move bringing her back as the party president. Sonia then went on to become the longest-serving Congress president and Pawar and rebels quit to form Nationalist Congress Party."

","Some 68 Bangladeshi expatriates were sent back home from Abu Dhabi International Airport yesterday after they allegedly failed to meet necessary conditions for their immigration clearance.  
Officials at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka said the expatriates flew back in a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight in the morning.
Of the 68 passengers, six flew from Bangladesh the previous night and the rest travelled to Abu Dhabi on Friday, he added.
An official of Prabashi Kalyan Desk at the airport said he talked to several passengers after their return and they mentioned different reasons for not getting their immigration clearance.
One returnee said he was refused because he travelled to the UAE without his required re-entry permit, said the official.
Another passenger said he wanted to go to Dubai after entering the UAE through the Abu Dhabi airport. But the authorities refused him immigration clearance, he added.
The official said the expatriates were returning to the UAE after their vacation ended.
Sheikh Bahar, a migrant worker from Feni, told The Daily Star that he travelled to Abu Dhabi airport in a Biman flight on Friday. He was refused immigration clearance because he did not have the online re-entry permit that he was supposed to carry with him from Bangladesh.
Bahar, who had been in the UAE for the last 10 years, said he filled out the online form on August 6, but did not get the reply confirming his re-entry permit in time.
On the other hand, he was in a hurry to enter the country as he was supposed to join his work after his vacation ended on August 14, he said, adding that he came to Bangladesh in March this year and was stranded amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Bahar also said as per the requirement, he underwent Covid-19 tests at a government-approved lab in Bangladesh and also at the Abu Dhabi airport.
He urged the authorities concerned to take effective steps to end his plight.
Contacted, Tahera Khandker, deputy general manager (public relations) of Biman, confirmed that some expatriates returned home from the Gulf state yesterday.
The flight carried more than 200 passengers, the Biman official told this newspaper over the phone.
As per a Biman notice issued on July 29, passengers who will travel to Dubai and Abu Dhabi from Bangladesh have to obtain Covid-19 negative certificates from the approved labs valid for 72 hours before their departure.
Biman, the national flag carrier, resumed its scheduled commercial flight operations to Abu Dhabi and Dubai last month after commercial flights on the routes were suspended in March amid the pandemic.
The UAE is home to several lakh Bangladeshi migrant workers. Many of them came home on vacation and later remained stranded due to flight suspensions amid the pandemic.
After an inter-ministerial meeting held virtually yesterday, Expatriates' Welfare Minister Imran Ahmad said measures would be taken for sending the expatriate Bangladeshis who were sent back from the Abu Dhabi airport after the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh submits a report, said a ministry press release.
The Caab has been asked to submit a report to the civil aviation and tourism ministry within the next five working days after probing the return of the expatriate workers in Biman and Air Arabia flights, he said.
The expatriates will be sent again in flights of the related airlines or under government arrangement, he added."

","Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal yesterday ripped into the observations of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) about the country's economic growth for the just-concluded fiscal year.
""The CPD guesstimates,"" he said, at a virtual meeting with income tax officials.
On Sunday, the CPD raised questions over the economic growth figure of 5.24 per cent estimated by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) for fiscal 2019-20.
The obvious repercussions of the pandemic on the economy were not adequately reflected in the provisional GDP growth estimate released by the statistical agency last week, the think-tank said in its review.
Economic growth figures are used as a tool to gain leverage in politics, said CPD Executive Director Fahmida Khatun at a virtual press briefing on Sunday.
But Kamal said: ""We did not say that we have achieved 8.2 per cent GDP growth; we said that we achieved 5.2 per cent growth based on data, not based on assumption.""
""CPD could have raised questions had we said that we achieved 8.2 per cent growth rate. The whole world believes the figures we come up with. CPD may not believe the figures,"" he added.
The BBS estimate beat forecasts by the Washington-based multilateral lenders World Bank and International Monetary Fund that the economy would grow between 1.6 per cent and 3.8 per cent in fiscal 2019-20 for the pandemic-whiplash.
The Asian Development Bank said the Bangladesh economy would expand at 4.5 per cent while the CPD earlier projected that the GDP growth would be no more than 2.5 per cent.
""You can realise whether the economy is growing or not just by looking at rivers, canals, roads, industries and the rural economy. You don't need mathematics for this,"" Kamal said.
The economic figures are given based on two things: one is an assumption and the other is based on data. The BBS presents figures on various economic sectors based on data, Kamal said. Whenever a budget is around, CPD makes observations and this has been going on for a decade.
""We are the raw materials for the CPD. CPD is engaged in commerce based on the data we provide. It is their business and it is an easy business. However, whenever we said something, it turned out to be true in the end.""
The finance minister alleged that CPD does not see power plants, mega projects and revenue generation.
The revenue generated in the last fiscal year almost the same as in the previous year, Kamal said. 
""Fiscal 2018-19 was normal. But we faced huge challenges last fiscal year. But the revenue generation fell short by only Tk 5,000 crore from what we achieved in fiscal 2018-19. This shows how much GDP growth the country posted.""
Revenue collection in fiscal 2019-20 dropped 2.26 per cent to Tk 218,406 crore because of the two-and-half-month-long countrywide general shutdown. This was the first-ever negative growth in Bangladesh's history.
At the meeting, Kamal decided to sit with income tax officials every quarter to take the stock of collections.
The meeting would see whether revenue generation is on track. If any problem is noticed and it appears that a task needs to be done, the issues would be resolved immediately, he said.
The tax administration has undertaken a raft of measures to accelerate revenue generation, said NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem.
""NBR is working on automation to stop tax dodging. We may not get results from the automation overnight, but we will get positive results.""
On 25 August, NBR will roll out the much-talked electronic fiscal devices (EFDs) as part of its effort to curb evasion of value-added tax paid by customers while purchasing goods and services.
The revenue collector aims to install 100 EFDs on a pilot basis initially at businesses in Dhaka and Chattogram.
Various economic indicators in July signalled that the revenue collection target set for the current fiscal year would be achieved, Kamal said.
NBR collected Tk 12,334 crore in July against the target of Tk 19,378 crore.
Income tax brought in Tk 3,735 crore, nearly half of the Tk 7,732-crore target set for the first month of the fiscal year.
Receipts from income tax were the only positive thing in the last fiscal year: it was up 0.14 per cent at Tk 73,004 crore. 
NBR would appoint officials to intensify revenue generation, said Muneem, adding that a project is being initiated to set up income tax offices in all upazilas and growth centres.
There are at least 4 crore people in the country who could pay taxes, as per NBR's estimates. It has about 40 lakh registered taxpayers but 22 lakh submitted returns in fiscal 2018-19.
""The efforts to bring the rest of the people under the tax network would continue,"" Muneem said."

The consensus of regional countries involved both directly and indirectly in the conflict is essential to achieving enduring peace. Anything less will only transfer the conflict to different parties resulting in the continuation of the war. While addressing the various conflicting views may be difficult if not impossible, the economic impact of Covid-19 has created a common ground for regional players to work together for direly needed economic recovery and growth. It may be time to transform the economic pressure into an opportunity for economic cooperation and regional integration that can have a boosting effect on the Afghan peace process. 
The sudden spread of Covid-19 caught policymakers off-guard, making it difficult for some central and south Asian countries to develop a well-thought strategy for combating the backbreaking economic impact of the virus. These countries who were already experiencing economic and financial challenges further slipped to the verge of deep recessions. Pakistan's rising public debt of 87.5 percent of GDP, inflation of 11.8 percent, a contracting economy with a projected growth of only 2 percent in 2021, a growing population whose 24.3 percent live under the poverty line and several other worsening economic indicators, reported by the World Bank, signifies the need for urgent action. Similarly, Iran who has been hit hard both by Covid-19 and US economic sanctions and India's slowing economic growth and increasing demand for energy necessitates the need for growth-oriented policies and strategies. Energy-rich central Asian countries, whose economies have not grown much since their independence from the Soviet Union, are struggling to liberalise their commodity-based economies, develop soft infrastructure, connect, and begin expanding their economies.
It is beyond doubt that economic integration and enhanced connectivity of south and central Asia can result in propitious economic conditions and favourable opportunities for all countries of the region. Enhanced regional connectivity that has been weak or non-existent due to the long war in Afghanistan is essential for realising potential economic benefits. The current situation may be an opportunity to focus on connectivity and, thus, secure cooperation in peace effort through an economic programme. The programme could connect Pakistan, India, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan through large transnational projects. Afghanistan, due to its geographical location, can play a key role in such connectivity by providing safe routes for trade and other economic exchanges. This will induce cooperation in peace efforts in Afghanistan as the success of the programme will depend on stability there.
As Afghan peace effort progresses, a concurrent multinational regional economic programme, supported by multilateral development agencies with investment contributions from the countries involved, that includes energy, transportation, and trade projects will result in regional integration, enhanced trade, and investment opportunities. A programme that includes transnational projects similar to CASA 100 that transfers energy from central Asia to Pakistan and India through Afghanistan will deflect the focus of the region from conflict to collaboration.  Pressured by deteriorating economies and demand for action by its citizens, such a programme will compel regional players to cooperate who, otherwise, may oppose each other in Afghan matters. The programme could provide a framework for economic connectivity, fostering cross-nation cooperation that will not only have a positive impact on the peace process in Afghanistan but could be instrumental in sustaining it.
Besides, sustaining endured peace inside Afghanistan is not possible if the population, including Taliban fighters, are not provided with a livelihood alternative. Taliban gained strength over the years, not because of their religious views but due to the availability of a large destitute and deprived pool of rural population, who did not benefit from the billions of dollars the world poured into the country. Living in meagre and lawless conditions with no alternatives to livelihood, many joined fighting groups to simply survive. According to the World Bank's new projections, over 71 percent of Afghans will fall below the poverty line this year. Access to a proper justice system, schooling, and effective governance is either very limited or does not exist, creating a perfect recruiting pool of people for terrorist and government-apposed groups. US-Taliban peace agreement and a possible Afghan government and Taliban peace deal will only translate into long-term stability and sustained peace if Taliban fighters and the poverty-stricken population are provided with economic opportunities enabling them to earn a livelihood for their families. The regional economic programme could provide livelihood opportunities for Afghans once multinational projects are implemented.
The peace agreement between the Taliban, the US, and the Afghan government will not lead to stability in Afghanistan unless all regional countries and groups reach an understanding. The worsening economic conditions of the region due to Covid-19 and the growing need for recovery and economic growth may be an opportunity to attain consensus by converging the regional countries into an economic programme. A conducive multinational regional economic programme that focuses on economic integration and development, supported by multilateral development agencies will deviate attention from war to economic development in the region, having a fortifying effect on sustained peace in Afghanistan.

","Multi-storied buildings in the capital are the most common breeding ground for Aedes mosquitoes -- carriers of both dengue and chikungunya viruses -- followed by the buildings under construction.
A survey conducted by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) during the monsoon has revealed that 51.34 percent of the spots, where Aedes larvae have been detected, were in multistoried buildings while 20.32 percent spots were in under-construction buildings.
Among others, 12.83 percent were in slum areas, 12.57 percent in individual buildings and 2.94 percent in abandoned lands.
The survey was conducted at 2,999 houses in 100 areas -- 41 in Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and 59 in Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) -- from July 19 to July 28. It detected Aedes larvae in 374 houses.
Experts urged the two city corporations and its residents to take necessary steps against Aedes as it spreads most rapidly during August and September.
According to the survey, the highest Breteau Index (BI) of 43.3 was measured in Kallyanpur, Paikpara and Mid Paikpara under ward-11 of DNCC.
A BI of 40 was found in Khilkhet, Kuril and Nikunja areas under ward-17 of DNCC and Mirhajirbagh, Dholaipar and Gandaria under ward-51 of DSCC.
Breteau Index (BI) is defined as the number of mosquito positive containers found in every 100 houses inspected in a given area. BI of an area over 20 means the area very risky for dengue virus.
Among the positive containers, 15.6 percent were flooded floor, 12.17 percent plastic drum, 9 percent plastic buckets, discarded tiers 8.52 percent, tray and flower tab 8.27 percent, water tank 6.08 percent, clay pot 5.11 percent, plastic bottle 3.65 percent, buckets of tin 3.16 percent and plastic mug 2.92 percent.
On the other hand, House Index (HI) is used as an indicator to measure the risk of contracting vector-borne diseases in a particular area. The situation is considered 'hazardous' if Aedes larvae or pupa are present in five or more houses out of every 100 in an area.
Though BI is comparatively low this year compared to the monsoon survey in 2018 and 2019, HI has remained almost the same, which indicates that the number of positive houses has not reduced, said Entomologist of Jahangirnagar University Kabirul Bashar.
He said as people have become aware, they destroyed many breeding sources, but their efforts were not up to the mark.
LGRD minister Md Tazul Islam told the Daily Star that they have taken various steps through two Dhaka city corporations to control the Aedes mosquitoes and this is why the number of cases was still very low.
He said the anti-mosquito drives have been going on by dividing different areas into zones and sub-zon es.
The minister said mobile courts are also to be formed to conduct drives against Aedes mosquitoes.
INITIATIVES OF TWO CITY CORPORATIONS
DNCC has conducted a combing operation from August 8 to August 20. This is the fourth combing operation it has carried out this year.
In the last three operations, DNCC found Aedes mosquito larvae at 2,686 houses after visiting 2,74,576 houses, said an official of DNCC.
The mobile courts have realised Tk 48,12,510 from the owners of the houses where the larvae were found.
DSCC has launched a year-long master plan in June this year to prevent the mosquito menace, said a DSCC official. 
It started a mobile court drive from August 16 to control Aedes mosquitoes.
According to DGHS data, a total of 389 dengue cases were reported with one death till August 16, of which 73 were outside Dhaka."

""The country's television channels do not require any separate government approval for publishing news online. The same rules should be applied for newspapers as well because those are published with government approval just like the television channels. Such a decision was made at a joint meeting of the information ministry and the organisations concerned,"" the Council said in a statement. 
Referring to the government decision that newspapers have to get separate approval for publishing news online, the Council urged the government to find a logical solution.
Naem Nizam, the editor of daily Bangladesh Pratidin, signed the statement on behalf of the Editors' Council.
""A list of 34 news portals was published in the first phase of registration of online news portals. We noticed with surprise that the names of the country's widely-circulated and reputed newspapers were not on the list,"" the statement reads.
""It is noticed with great concern that incidents of harassment and filing cases against journalists across the country have increased at an alarming rate. And the Digital Security Act is being used purposefully for this. We strongly protest it.
""There is no safeguard for newspapers and journalists. We think it is very urgent to bring necessary amendments to the law,"" it noted.
The statement further mentioned that the newspaper industry is facing an uncertain future across the globe amid the coronavirus pandemic.
""The newspaper industry in Bangladesh is facing the same situation. The number of readers as well as the circulation of newspapers has dropped. Advertisements have declined alarmingly.
""The newspapers in the country have never faced such a situation before. We have continued publications despite all the obstacles.
""But the newspaper industry has not received any substantial assistance and cooperation from the government... It is deprived of the government support that profit-making industries have received. The newspapers placed their demands before the ministries concerned at different times. But sadly the government has never taken those demands into account…
""Amid the pandemic, journalists are risking their lives to serve the people. They have to work in the face of threats and intimidation. News organisations and journalists are being forced to maintain self-censorship, which creates obstacles to building healthy administrative and social systems,"" it added."

","Health Minister Zahid Maleque yesterday said the government was going to take an initiative to start antigen rapid testing in public Covid-19 labs to diagnose the coronavirus.
He was addressing an event marking the handover of medical equipment, a donation from the Taiwan External Trade Development Centre, to the Bangladesh government to fight novel coronavirus outbreak.
""Three types of tests are conducted for diagnosing coronavirus. These are PCR test, antigen test and the rapid antibody test. The government has no plan for now to conduct antibody test. Initiatives are being taken to carry out antigen test alongside the PCR test only at government laboratories,"" the minister told the programme at the secretariat.
Zahid said all government departments related to Covid-19 were active in bringing vaccines to the country. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina would make a right decision at the right time after scrutinising the quality of the vaccines, he added.
On June 3, the National Technical Advisory Committee on Covid-19 had recommended introducing the antigen rapid testing in the country. Many health experts have been stressing for months on using both antigen and antibody rapid tests to ease the pressure on pathology service.
Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are easy-to-use paper tests to facilitate testing outside of laboratory settings. The results of the tests are available within a short time ranging from a few minutes to half an hour.
Meanwhile, 42 more people died from novel coronavirus in 24 hours till 8:30am yesterday, according to a press release of the Directorate General of Health Services.
With this, the death toll from the virus in the country rose to 3,983. The death rate was 1.34 percent.
During the same 24-hour period, as many as 13,382 samples were tested in 91 laboratories across the country and 2,485 of them tested positive for the virus with a positivity rate of 18.57 percent.
The overall positivity rate in the country now stands at 20.40 percent with 297,083 confirmed Covid-19 cases till 8:30am yesterday.
The DGHS release said 3,784 patients recovered from the virus infection during the 24-hour period. With them, the overall recovery rate crossed 61 percent (61.56).
Of the latest deceased, 31 were males and 11 females. Thirty-eight of them died at hospital and four at home.
Two of the dead were aged between 31 and 40, nine between 41 and 50, 12 between 51 and 60 while 19 were aged over 60."

","Only one out of the 28 non-listed insurance companies offloaded shares even though Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal in September last year warned that their licences will be cancelled if they fail to go public within three months.
The Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) in February approved the initial public offering of Express Insurance, a non-life insurer that raised Tk 26.7 crore from the capital market.
""Some other companies are also trying to get listed. You may see them in the market soon,"" said Sheikh Kabir Hossain, president of the Bangladesh Insurance Association.
The process has been delayed as the coronavirus pandemic has thrown a spanner in the works, he added.
On its debut on the Dhaka Stock Exchange yesterday, Express Insurance's stock soared 50 per cent to Tk 15 and turnover hit Tk 13 lakh.
However, questions surfaced over its intention of raising funds as the company will utilise the IPO proceeds as deposits for bank fixed deposit receipts and investment in the stock market.
The insurer will invest Tk 20.6 crore in FDR and treasury bonds, Tk 4 crore in the capital market and spend the rest on IPO expenses.
""That means the company didn't need capital at all. It went public only to do the bidding of the minister. If they invest the IPO money in FDR and stock market, why should people go to them rather than asset management companies?"" said a top official of a merchant bank asking not to be named.
This type of companies run the risk of turning into junk shares eventually, the official added.
The company's IPO subscription opening was initially scheduled for 13 April but the subscription was suspended temporarily due to the outbreak of coronavirus and market closure.
The revised IPO subscription date was 14 June to 18 June and the IPO was oversubscribed by six times.
Express Insurance was incorporated in 2000 for carrying out all kinds of general insurance activities.
The company has 20 branches across the country. At present, its paid-up capital is Tk 65 crore.
As per the financial statement for the year that ended on 31 December 2018, the company's net asset value (NAV) was Tk 18.72 per share and earnings per share Tk 1.12.
Currently, 48 life and non-life insurance companies are listed with the Dhaka bourse.
In the last few days, general insurance companies listed with the bourses have been doing better.
The sector grew 41 per cent in July and was second on the top turnover list.
The average daily turnover of the insurance companies was Tk 39.52 crore during the time.
Eastern Insurance topped the gainers' list last month when its price rose 154 per cent, followed by Paramount Insurance, Pioneer Insurance, Dhaka Insurance, Agrani Insurance, Provati Insurance, Asia Insurance and Pragati Insurance."

","Bangladesh's pharmaceutical sector could fetch up to Tk 700 crore by the end of fiscal 2020-21 from export of Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral medication that has proven to be effective for the treatment of severe Covid-19 cases, according to industry insiders.
Eskayef (SK-F), Beacon, Incepta, Beximco, Healthcare and Square are producing a generic version of the drug, which was first developed by American biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences.
Remdesivir, initially a failed attempt to treat those afflicted with SARS or Ebola, resurfaced as a viable treatment for coronavirus infections after experiments carried out by Gilead indicated that the condition of patients who received the drug showed notable signs of improvement.
Eskayef, a leading pharmaceutical company of Bangladesh, was the first drug manufacturer in the world to successfully produce generic Remdesivir, said Mohammad Mujahidul Islam, the company's director for marketing and sales.
Thanks to its classification as a least-developed country, Bangladesh was granted access to the patent to manufacture and export the drug.
As such, Eskayef already started shipping the product under its brand name 'Remivir', Islam said, adding that he sees good potential for export earnings as global demand is on an upward trend.
Eskayef is also in the process of exporting to regulated markets.
""This has certainly uplifted the image of our country in the global arena,"" he said, adding that Eskayef is exporting its pharmaceutical products to 45 countries across Europe, Australia, Africa and Asia.
Similarly, Beacon, another leading pharmaceutical company, exports Remdesivir under the brand name 'Pandovir'.
The company already shipped more than Tk 120 crore of the product to 21 destinations while 18 other countries, including some in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, are currently negotiating for supply, said Monjurul Alam, Beacon's director for global business.
According to Alam, Bangladeshi companies should be able to export a combined total of at least Tk 700 crore of the product this year.
While the pandemic has had an adverse effect on other sectors, it has come as a blessing for the pharmaceutical industry as local drug makers used it to demonstrate their efficiency and quality to the international market.
It is really a benefit for the country's image to be the first to provide Remdesivir globally, Alam added.
Rabbur Reza, chief operating officer of Beximco, told The Daily Star that his company is exporting Remdesivir to 10 countries, including some in Latin America and the Middle East.
""We will export the medicine through our government and so, we are receiving requests through their governments only,"" he added.
In June, Beximco exported the drug under its brand name 'Bemsivir to Pakistan following a request from the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka.
Beximco was requested by the official authorities to provide Bemsivir for a small group of critically ill patients against a special import permit issued by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan, he said.
Bangladesh's pharmaceutical exports grew significantly in the latter part of the previous fiscal year due to the steady rise in demand for medical products amid the coronavirus-induced economic and health crisis that decimated the other major export sectors.
Pharmaceutical shipments increased 4.5 per cent year-on-year to $136 million in fiscal 2019-20 following improvements in product quality and policy support.
The industry is one of a handful of sectors that ended the last fiscal year in the black as national exports slumped 16.9 per cent."
www.thedailystar.net/business/news/higher-jute-prices-make-growers-happy-millers-concerned-1950593,Business,2020-08-25T00:00:00+06:00,2020-08-25T00:00:00+06:00,"Higher jute prices make growers happy, millers concerned","Farmers are getting higher prices for raw jute after cyclone Amphan and prolonged floods damaged part of their cash crop, but millers are not happy with the price spiral, which they say will push up production costs and affect demand from buyers abroad.

","Farmers are getting higher prices for raw jute after cyclone Amphan and prolonged floods damaged part of their cash crop, but millers are not happy with the price spiral, which they say will push up production costs and affect demand from buyers abroad.
In the face of speculation of huge crop losses and low yield this year, the prices of high-quality raw jute soared to as high as Tk 2,600 each maund in the middle of this month.
Eventually, the Bangladesh Jute Spinners Association (BJSA) that represents jute yarn makers, who are the main export earner and consumer of jute, asked its members to buy the best grades of the natural fibre at prices not above Tk 2,300 each maund from their suppliers.
The development came at the end of last week and the prices declined.
Farmers are selling the highest quality of jute at Tk 2,300-Tk 2,350 each maund, said jute traders and industry insiders.
Jute spinners also demanded the government impose an export duty of $250 on each tonne of raw jute to curb shipment and meet the requirements of the local mills.
The Bangladesh Jute Mills Association (BJMA), a platform of private jute millers, also voiced concerns.
On 19 August, BJMA urged the Department of Jute (DoJ) for holding an urgent meeting with all stakeholders to take stock of production and internal requirements for the sake of keeping the jute mills up and running.
""The season has just begun but prices of raw jute are too high. We will not be able to sell the produce if prices go up to a very high level,"" said BJMA Chairman Mohammed Mahbubur Rahman Patwari.
There has been speculation of damage to a large amount of crop for floods in the northern districts. ""There might not be any surplus this year,"" he said, adding that mills and export of jute goods would not be affected if prices remain within Tk 2,300 a maund.
""If the prices exceed that level, the cost of our products will increase as well. As a result, it will be difficult for us to sell our goods and this will impact the industry in the long run,"" he said.
Farmers sowed jute on 7.26 lakh hectares this year, up 9 per cent year-on-year, according to data from the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE).
DAE estimates that repeated floods damaged jute on more than 26,000 hectares causing farmers a loss of about Tk 211 crore.
""The overall production situation is very bad as a huge amount of crop has been damaged,"" said Md Shahid Hossain Dulal, a raw jute trader.
Farmers produce nearly 80 lakh bales of jute annually as a cash crop to profit from bulk purchases by state-owned and private jute mills as well as raw jute exporters.
This year, the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC) is not buying the natural fibre as the government has shuttered all the 25 state-owned jute mills to get rid of continuous losses.
Private millers and raw jute exporters are the only buyers now: private mills consume nearly 50 lakh bales of raw jute to make yarn/twine, sacks and hessian products, mainly for the export market, while 14 lakh bales of raw jute are exported annually.
BJMA Chairman Patwari said they are not in favour of banning the export of raw jute but the government should take measures to create a win-win situation for all.
""We want all in the value chain to make a profit,"" he said.
BJSA Chairman Md Zahid Miah echoed the same, saying that floods damaged 25-30 per cent of the crop and total production might be below the industrial and other domestic requirements.
Against this backdrop, excessive export would hurt local spinners and jute millers.
""We will earn some money if we sell our raw materials. But our foreign currency earnings will be higher if we export by adding value. We have no objection to exporting the surplus after meeting the domestic demand,"" he added.
Jute spinners use 35 lakh bales of raw jute to make exportable yarn, which accounted for 64 per cent of the export receipts for the industry in fiscal year 2019-20.
Exports from jute and jute goods rose last fiscal year, while shipment in July in the current year is also showing an upward trend.
Miah said carpet factories, mainly in Turkey, are the major buyers of Bangladesh's jute yarn, but because of the pandemic, demand has died down.
""Carpet is not an essential item. As its demand has fallen, prices also declined.""
Buyers will move away from jute yarn and look for alternatives such as cotton if prices of jute go up further.
If spinners can buy the best quality raw jute at Tk 2,300 a maund, all the stakeholders, including farmers, workers and buyers, will survive, Miah added.
However, Muzibor Rahman, a farmer at Charbhadrasan of Faridpur, one of the major jute-producing districts, is not willing to offer a discount.
Prices of the best quality jute were Tk 2,500-Tk 2,600 each maund and farmers are making some profit due to this high range of price, he told The Daily Star over the phone yesterday.
""We will not grow jute if we don't get good prices,"" he said.
The government should not put any bar on the export of raw jute for the interests of growers and jute exporters, said Arzu Rahman Bhuiyan, senior vice-president of the Bangladesh Jute Association.
Both the farmers and exporters suffered for the ban on the export of raw jute in the past, he said.
The issue of discouraging export depends on policymakers and only the textiles and jute ministry has the authority to take such a decision, said DoJ Director General Sowdagar Mustafizur Rahman.
He said farmers are benefitted if prices of their produce such as jute increase during the harvesting season.
""Now farmers are getting the benefits, which is good. This will encourage them to produce more in the next season. If prices go up three months later, we should note that the benefit is going to the pockets of the middlemen,"" he added.
Textiles and Jute Secretary Lokman Hossain Miah could not be reached by phone for comments."

However, in certain years, due to heavy rainfall and the flow of upstream water, floods become devastating. ","Every year, Bangladesh suffers from floods that cause loss of life, livelihoods, crops and property. However, in certain years, due to heavy rainfall and the flow of upstream water, floods become devastating. The floods of 1988, 1998, 2004, 2007 and 2017 are examples of when Bangladesh has seen the severity of floods in terms of duration and damages. The floods of 2020 have also emerged as one of those natural disasters, since the shocks are being felt by a large number of people for a prolonged period. It has been more than 40 days since the northern, north-eastern and south-eastern regions of Bangladesh are experiencing floods. Jamalpur, Kurigram and Lalmonirhat districts are reported to be among the most affected, while Rajbari, Bogura and Manikganj are the moderately affected districts. In more than 33 districts of the country, about six percent of the total population of Bangladesh have been affected so far.
The impact of floods is multi-dimensional, which encompasses economic and social aspects. Although floods are still ongoing and the actual cost of damages will be estimated by the Department of Disaster Management of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief once floods are over, some preliminary reports have assessed their impacts in 2020. The early assessment by the Needs Assessment Working Group (NAWG), which is a platform for government and non-government humanitarian agencies, indicates damages in several areas. These include loss of agricultural production, fisheries, livestock and poultry, and damages to food stock, infrastructure, roads, culverts, embankments, local markets, schools and health clinics. This has resulted in not only shortages of food, but also contributed to a lack of pure drinking water and a barely functional sanitation system. Livelihood systems have been disrupted due to loss of employment and the limited scope of income earning activities. Hence, livelihood, food security and healthcare are currently the major concerns among a large number of flood-affected people.
This year's floods are like a double whammy for Bangladesh since the country is fighting the coronavirus pandemic along with the rest of the world. Several people were already without jobs and income for the last few months because of Covid-19. The situation has been aggravated by the floods, especially in affected districts such as Jamalpur, Sunamganj and Netrokona, where people were already vulnerable because of the pandemic. While people had to be evacuated to shelters from their inundated and damaged homes, health protocols of Covid-19 such as physical distancing, hand wash and mask use were not maintained. This created risks of the spread of coronavirus among the flood affected people. Also, the floods have made it difficult for people to access healthcare since mobility is restricted and healthcare services have been disrupted. Lack of healthcare facilities at the local level may worsen the coronavirus situation, in addition to the usual risk of increased waterborne diseases and infections during floods. Women, particularly pregnant women, as well as girls, children, elderly people and persons with disability, are more vulnerable due to the disrupted healthcare system.
The government has initiated relief and rehabilitation measures in affected areas, but the adequacy and coverage of relief have to be expanded in view of the demand for support. The government relief measures are mostly targeted based on the level of poverty. However, during floods, people from other socioeconomic backgrounds also become susceptible. The relief needs to be distributed among those who are facing survival challenges during floods, rather than going by the poverty list.
Since the impact of floods is location specific, the allocation of relief has to be based on the need of each specific locality. Moreover, the types of flood relief have to be different from the usual relief items such as cash and food. During floods, people need items such as cooked food, drinking water and medicine. Keeping in mind the coronavirus pandemic, special health related support will be needed this time as well.
Ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in relief distribution is critical to make the best use of the limited resources that the country has. A common criticism of the social safety net programmes in Bangladesh is that they suffer from lack of accountability. There are both inclusion and exclusion errors in the beneficiary lists, which include many who do not need support while excluding several others who do. This could be the case in the distribution of flood relief too. The local administration should involve non-government and community level organisations in the identification and selection of flood affected people, and also in the distribution of relief. For the sake of transparency, the local administration should publish the list of recipients so that local people can see for themselves who have received relief and who have not.
The rehabilitation of food supply will require attention to both crop and non-crop sectors, including agriculture, fisheries and livestock. According to experts, the floods may persist till September. This risks Aman cultivation and food security. Therefore, the government has to procure enough rice from domestic and international markets. In case of rice imports, a realistic assessment of the need should be made to protect the interests of both farmers and consumers. Timely decision-making on rice imports by policymakers is crucial since the rice exporting countries are likely to take restrictive measures during the pandemic period.
As the impacts of natural disasters such as flood are mostly similar every year, one would expect that the recovery measures are also well known. However, after every disastrous flood, the same issues surface afresh. For example, how efficient has the early warning system been, what has been the preparations including maintenance of shelters and the evacuation system, why were the embankments not repaired in time, and why was the flawed infrastructure not abandoned already?
From media reports, it is clear that crops have been damaged in places where there are no embankments. Districts with higher water levels than others have nevertheless been less affected, as they have better embankments and infrastructure. Reconstruction of damaged embankments have to be done regularly. Besides, some infrastructure such as culverts cause waterlogging, which have to be replaced by bridges. For effective infrastructure development, coordination among various ministries and departments—including the Ministry of Water Resources, the local government engineering department, and the roads and highways department—is necessary. The role of the Ministry of Finance is also very important since more resources are needed and timely disbursement of funds is crucial. One of the concerns regarding project implementation in Bangladesh is its cycle. The delay in the initiation of the project implementation process has been a perennial problem. However, if we want to reduce the sufferings induced by floods, the work on repairing embankments should be finished by March of the coming year. 
Each year, when the country faces floods, these issues resurface even though floods are not unusual in Bangladesh. About 17 percent of Bangladesh remains underwater throughout the year, which is needed for environmental balance. Regular floods inundate around 18 percent of Bangladesh. So, approximately 35 percent of the country is under water during regular floods. Therefore, Bangladesh will have to learn to live with this situation. Indeed, Bangladeshi people have been coping with this annual deluge historically. What is needed most is to learn how to manage floods better with minimum damage of lives and livelihoods, and how to reduce flood-induced vulnerability. Adapting to floods is the key strategy for Bangladesh and a crucial part of its policy on disaster risk reduction.

This continued for almost a month after Myanmar security forces launched a deadly crackdown, or ""clearance operation"", targeting the minority population from Rakhine state. A 444-page report prepared by the UN's Independent Facts Finding Commission confirmed that more than 725,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh, at least 10,000 Rohingya were killed, hundreds of women and girls were raped (mostly gang-raped), and around 392 Rohingya villages were partially or fully destroyed.
Since then, Bangladesh has become home to 1.1 million Rohingya refugees, including those who have fled previous bouts of violence as well as new arrivals. Kutupalong refugee camp, which covers an area of 13 kilometres, has become the largest refugee camp in the world for hosting 700,000 Rohingya refugees in a single camp. Today marks the third anniversary of the Rohingya influx in Bangladesh, but the solution to the Rohingya crisis has not been found yet.
The Rohingya community living in Bangladesh are frequently portrayed in two ways—national and international human rights bodies focus on their everyday struggle for food and water supply, sanitation, healthcare, housing, education, cooking materials, childcare, maternity support and daily essentials; whilst the host community often criticise the easy access of refugees to support from national and international aid agencies. There are also increasing concerns regarding the growing degradation of the local ecology, rapid deforestation from using firewood, mounting illegal border trade, encroaching of grassland for livestock rearing and more. These issues are gradually eroding the space of coexistence between the host community and refugees.
Besides, growing tensions in connection with inter-group and intra-group conflicts as well as militant activities in the refugee camps, mounting cases of trafficking, and worries of reduced aid due to decreasing international support, are increasing the mistrust between the Rohingya and the host community, which is some cause for concern.    
During the last three years, two repatriation attempts were made. The first one was on November 15, 2018, and the second one was in August 2019, but they failed mainly due to three reasons. Firstly, Myanmar's continued reluctance and unwillingness to bring the Rohingya back. There were no convincing and tangible preparations taken by Myanmar in accordance with the ""Arrangement on the return of displaced person from Rakhine State"" signed between Bangladesh and Myanmar in January 2018.
Secondly, the international community did not support the repatriation attempts, which  they termed as a premature move, because Rakhine's situation remained unchanged and thereby, unsafe for the Rohingyas. Thirdly, the Rohingya refugees declined to return voluntarily because Myanmar had failed to give any reliable promise or consistent commitment to the Rohingya to guarantee their rights as citizens of Myanmar. Afterwards, the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic affected the camps and halted all repatriation endeavours.
As a result, the fate of repatriation is hanging in the balance, and the future of the Rohingya is becoming increasingly uncertain. It is clear that Myanmar is in no hurry to resolve the Rohingya crisis, with no concrete steps mapped out to address or redress injustices in their country. On the other hand, Bangladesh seems increasingly more reluctant to host such a massive refugee population on its territory. Three years have passed, but there is no light at the end of the tunnel for the persecuted Rohingya population.
Perhaps mounting pressure from the international community and international rights bodies, media portrayal of Rohingya vulnerabilities and continued efforts from Bangladesh might compel Myanmar to initiate the repatriation process for the third time, but it would certainly fail again because there are no dependable promises or tangible preparations from the Myanmar end that would give the Rohingya enough trust to return to their homeland voluntarily. However, based on previous experiences and the unexpected present situation, we can assume that Bangladesh will not willingly host 1.1 million Rohingya any more or give them space for social integration at any cost, and the option of third country resettlement has also been stopped because of the pandemic.
Considering these multifaceted dilemmas, the Rohingya people are leading their lives in extreme uncertainty. We can see no bright light of hope except their struggling present and an uncertain future. Although the Rohingya eagerly await a safe and dignified return to their homeland, they find little hopes in the given context of the Rohingya crisis.
The question now is: what needs to be done for the future of the Rohingya people? We strongly expect, with a renewed appeal, that the international community should uphold the idea of ""burden-sharing"" to help the Rohingya in refugee camps and make their lives more ""liveable"" in Bangladesh. There should also be efforts to form a ""collective and global force"" to compel Myanmar to comply with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1948 to bring the Rohingya living in Bangladesh back to Myanmar with safety, dignity and legal recognition by conferring citizenship on them.

A total of 12,221 hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centres did apply and 4,521 of them received the licence.
At present, 3,256 are pending for renewal after completing the formalities, 2,674 are waiting for inspection by officials, and 1,736 other facilities have already been inspected, according to data from the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).
""We are now scrutinising the applications,"" Farid Hossain Miah, director (hospitals and clinics) at the DGHS, told The Daily Star yesterday.
About the facilities that had not applied for licence, he said, some might have already been closed.
""We will get a clearer picture when we get information from the civil surgeon offices. The civil surgeon offices will inform us which hospitals have renewed and which ones have not…""
Bangladesh Private Clinic Diagnostic Owners Association has said they hoped the government would extend the deadline.
But a government committee said the establishments that didn't apply for licence were illegal and the facilities would  be sealed off.
On July 23, the ministry issued a circular giving private hospitals, clinics and diagnostic centres one month to renew their licence.
A top member of the government committee told The Daily Star, wishing not to be named, ""We found that some hospitals and clinics did not feel the need to apply. It's  unacceptable. The next meeting of the committee will be in the first week of next month and their fate will be decided there.""
DGHS officials said private facilities started renewing their licence after the committee warned them.
The issue came into the fore after the Regent Hospital scam was exposed.
It was found that two thirds of the country's over 15,000 private clinics and diagnostic centres had been running without any valid licence since 2018.
The renewal of licences has been slow since 2018, when the DGHS began ""digitalising"" the process, said officials.
Only seven people were assigned for this Herculean task and only three officials for looking after the licence of around 5,000 clinics and diagnostic centres in Dhaka.
DGHS sources said on September 4, 2018, a circular was issued hiking the license issuance fees of private hospitals and clinics from Tk 5,000 to Tk 50,000-2,50,000.
Clinics and diagnostic centres need environmental clearance, employee details, city corporation clearance, tax certificates and several other documents to get their licence renewed every year.
Sources said producing the documents is also a barrier for the private hospitals and clinics to keep the licence updated.
Maniruzzaman Bhuiyan, president of Bangladesh Private Clinic Diagnostic Owners Association, said, the 3,500 clinics and diagnostic centres that had not come under the registration process should be investigated.
According to DGHS data published in 2018, there are 17,244 private hospitals, clinics, diagnostic centres and blood banks in the country."

","A court in Cox's Bazar yesterday granted bail to a women and her two daughters, who were tortured in broad daylight on Friday over ""cattle theft"" in the district's Harbang union.
Judge Rajib Kumar Dev of Cox's Bazar Senior Judicial Magistrate's Court passed the order in the morning, said defence lawyer Md Ilias Arif.
Meanwhile, the High Court yesterday said it would interfere if any irregularity takes place in the investigation into torture of five people, including the three woman, in Cox's Bazar. It also said it was monitoring the developments.
The bail order came after the three women -- Parvin, her daughters Selina Akhter Sheuli and Rozina Akhter and two other accused Emran, Parvin's son, and one Chuttu -- were produced before the court, said Ilias.
""The court, however, sent Emran and Chuttu to jail after rejecting their bail petition,"" Ilias added.
The five were tortured in broad daylight following an incident of ""cattle theft"" and were paraded through villages with their hands tied with rope on Friday.
Following abuse and humiliation, the five were handed to Harbang police outpost. A video footage and some images of the incident went viral on social media on Saturday night, creating a public outcry.
A case was filed against the five for cattle theft with the police station on Friday night.
The HC bench of Justice Obaidul Hassan and Justice AKM Zahirul Huq said this after two lawyers placed the newspaper reports on the incident before it for a suo motu (voluntaril) order to this effect.
Lawyers Jasmine Sultana and Jamiul Hoque Faisal placed the reports published on The Daily Star, the Prothom Alo, and the Ittefaq yesterday.
The Daily Star report said five people, including three women, have been tortured in broad daylight following a ""cattle theft"" incident at Harbang union in Cox's Bazar's Chakoria.
The deputy commissioner of Cox's Bazar has formed a three-member probe committee, led by Shabasti Roy, deputy director of local government department, to probe the incident.
The committee has been asked to submit a report within seven working days, according to The Daily Star report."

","For 29-year-old Taiyyaba Khatun, a Rohingya woman living in Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh, providing food for her children became an everyday struggle after she had a fall out with her husband.
""He moved to Cox's Bazar and left me all alone to look after our five children. A friend of mine told me she can find me work as a maid in India. She put me in touch with a trafficker who first took me to Dhaka, and then across the border to India. But when I got there, he sold me to a man for Tk 30,000,"" she said.
""He took me on a train and I ended up in New Delhi, where I was sold to a brothel. I cannot describe what I went through for the next few months there. I begged one of my customers to let me use his phone, but I couldn't reach anyone. Then one day, I managed to escape.""
Taiyyaba wandered the streets of New Delhi, not being able to communicate with her broken Hindi, and ended up outside a roadside restaurant, exhausted and in tears.
Eventually, locals helped her reach a police station.
""From there, they moved me to a shelter with other women who had been trafficked from Bangladesh to India. There were some Rohingya girls there too.""
At the shelter, Taiyyaba found herself trapped behind a wall of red tape. Although she was trafficked to India in 2015, it took her almost four years to return to the refugee camps in Bangladesh, and even this was only possible via illegal channels, she told this correspondent recently.
""They kept saying they are working on my application, but I could not go back if my address in Bangladesh could not be verified. I am a refugee, how do I show any address other than that of the refugee camp?""
""I had left my children with my mother, and I was worried sick about them. In the end, she managed to raise enough money to pay another trafficker, who brought me back to the camps in Bangladesh.""
In January, Rab rescued 13 Rohingya women from a house in the capital's Aftabnagar and arrested two members of a human trafficking gang.
According to an official statement, these men were connected to sex slavery rings and were planning on trafficking the girls to India and Malaysia.
""There is no clear data on the number of Rohingya girls being trafficked abroad from the refugee camps in Bangladesh, but there are definitely many girls who are ending up as prostitutes in India, Nepal, and even the UK. Once they leave the country, it is almost impossible to reunite them with their family members who are also refugees, even after they are rescued from sex slavery,"" said human rights lawyer Razia Sultana.
Pinaki Sinha, executive director of Saanlap, an Indian NGO which runs shelters for victims of trafficking rescued within the country, added, ""Even in the case of Bangladeshi victims of trafficking who are rescued in India, it can take two to three years to cut through the administrative red tape and arrange for their return.""
""When the person in question is a refugee, it becomes a more complicated issue for the two countries to resolve based on each case,"" he added.
Asked, Additional Secretary Abu Bakr Siddique, who heads the anti-trafficking cell at the Ministry of Home Affairs, said he has not come across any requests of repatriation back to the refugee camps from trafficked Rohingya women.
""I cannot tell you about what happens in this scenario practically,"" he said, adding, ""But even in terms of Bangladeshi victims of trafficking, it can take time to verify their addresses and bring them back through the official channels. Without this verification process, we cannot bring anyone back, so how can we do it with refugees?""
This inflexibility over the verification of proof of address, which is a necessary condition for trafficking victims to be reunited with their families, means that refugees who cannot provide this can become trapped in the countries they have been trafficked to indefinitely.
This is the case for 17-year-old Hafiza, who was taken to India two years ago by a ""family friend"".
Although her parents were at first reluctant to discuss the real reasons, her mother later confided that they were hoping to find a prospective groom for her.
""We trusted our contacts and found a good Rohingya man living in India,"" she shared. ""We did not even dream such a thing would happen. Once she went across the border, she disappeared. We didn't hear from her for almost a year.""
""I cried for my daughter every day. How could this happen to her? Then one day, I got a phone call saying she was in a shelter in India. She had fallen into bad hands and had to be rescued from them.""
 
 
Since then, Hafiza's application for repatriation back to the camps has been ""under process"".
""I just want my daughter back home with me. I wish now that I had never tried to get her married. I just wanted her to have a better life in another country.""
According to Razia Sultana, who is also the founder of Rohingya Women Welfare, the promise of marriage and a better life is one of the most common ways to lure young girls out of the camps and into sex slavery.
""We try very hard to make families aware of the dangers of using these trafficking routes, and ask them to focus on educating and empowering their daughters instead,"" she explained. ""Now, there are many Rohingya women in the community who are working towards similar ends.""
Shamsun Nahar, who runs a training centre in Kutupalong (with donations from expatriate Rohingya) to teach embroidery and other crafts to Rohingya girls, is one such woman.
After she became a refugee in 2017, she received training as a psychosocial worker from an INGO, which she now employs to talk to the girls she works with.
""Our community is quite conservative and there is a tendency to marry at a young age, often as teenagers,"" she said. ""I try very hard to engage with the girls at my centre about the dangers of early marriage, especially the health related factors.""
""For most Rohingya families living as refugees in Bangladesh, the best they can hope for their daughters is to get them married to an expatriate Rohingya living in India, Malaysia or Thailand,"" she said.
Noor, one of the teenage girls from her centre, agreed to this point of view. At only 14 years old, she has accepted an arranged marriage to a 22-year-old Rohingya man from Malaysia as a stepping stone to a better life outside of the refugee camps. 
""My older sister got married at 13, so it is only natural it be my turn now. I heard my future husband is a good man with a steady income. I am happy with this decision, I don't want to be a refugee forever,"" she said.
When asked how she will reach her future husband in Malaysia, Noor says their families will ""find a way.""
While there seems to be a general level of anxiety pervading the camps over the uncertainty regarding their futures, especially in the younger generations, more and more Rohingya girls are opting to forego marriage and work within their communities instead.
""Since we started working in the refugee camps in 2017, we have seen some big changes,"" Erum Marium, executive director of the Brac Institute of Educational Development, told The Daily Star.
""At first the families were quite cautious about sending their daughters to the child- and adolescent-friendly spaces we had created, but a huge strength of this community is that they are very willing to engage, and over time, they were very receptive to our interventions.""
""For example, despite all the restrictions and strict gender roles, a large number of women took up the roles of Myanmar language facilitators at learning centres in the camps. The Rohingya youth are a vibrant and resilient group and are very open to new opportunities,"" Marium added.
Rubina (15) is one such Rohingya adolescent with the hopes of working for the betterment of her community.
""Before I became a refugee, I dreamed of being a school teacher,"" she said. ""I studied in Rakhine and even when the authorities shut my school down, my father hired a private tutor for me. I want to keep studying, and I want to teach other Rohingya girls about the importance of being educated as well.""
""I would never get married at an early age, I know my rights,"" she added defiantly."

Tips and tricks to regain sheen and shimmer in dull hair
·    Yoghurt hair mask is a great way to bring back the shine.
·    Other DIY methods could be to put on a home-made papaya mask or a banana mask with an ample amount of honey in it, helping to bring back life into dull and lifeless hair.
What to do with long, unruly quarantine hair?
·    Embrace the longer hair style, or cut it short with the help of experts (only) in a COVID-19 safe salon.
·    Don't try any adventurous cuts at home as a personal project, this may turn out to be disastrous!
·    To trim hair, take the edges and snip off dull ends with a sharp scissor. Take help from loved ones if you feel less confident.
·    Men can try out interesting styles like 'the man bun,' 'the low ponytail,' or hair bands for the time-being to embrace their long, pandemic hair.
·    Use good quality styling products like a mousse, hair-gel etc. to tame unruly hair.
What to do with unpleasant hair roots? 

·    Try out box colours for the moment. But make sure to use it only on the roots. Follow the instructions given in the package religiously. Don't keep the colours on for a longer time than specified. This will only dry-out the hair and make it look even more dull.
·    To give a unified sheen to the entire hair, you may choose to colour the rest of the hair, but make sure to keep it on for a maximum of 10 minutes, to prevent any sort of over-drying.
How to choose hair colours?
·    Level is how much lift the colour has. The higher the number, the lighter the colour.
·    Warm skin colour tones should go for lower numbers (specified on the boxes) and vice versa.
·    An olive toned person can choose deep brown, burgundy, cinnamon, etc. whereas a cooler toned person will look better in ash, blondes, blues and violets, etc.
Is HairBar Bangladesh open for clients?
Yes, it is, with all the precautions specified by WHO. We value the lives of our clients first over anything else.
Is HairBar Bangladesh all about hair care only?
No, not at all! We provide all kinds of beauty and makeup support at our salon. You can definitely get a facial, manicure and pedicure while colouring your hair at our salon.

Perhaps, he liked motorbikes almost as much as we do. And when you customise them to suit your needs, be it performance or cosmetic, they truly take on a unique identity, and that is usually why they are cherished possessions of their owners.

","Remember when Bon Jovi said ""I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride""? Perhaps, he liked motorbikes almost as much as we do. And when you customise them to suit your needs, be it performance or cosmetic, they truly take on a unique identity, and that is usually why they are cherished possessions of their owners.
There are a lot of options out there, and here's what you should know before you start tinkering with your bike.
If you like your bike to stand out in terms of aesthetics, it's probably a good idea to apply a customised paintjob with a colour that appeals to your taste. Remember that chrome paints will make it look shiny, but also consider the possibility of scratches on chrome. If a custom paintjob is too expensive for you, there's always vinyl wraps available in a huge variety of matte and glossy colours and finishes.
Alex, a stunt performer and owner of a bike servicing shop, shared some tips for beginning modders.
""You want to start small. Headlights, tail lights, handlebars are the ones you should start with,"" he said.
The wheel lights will give you a very sci-fi vibe to your ride, the neon accent lights under the chassis will give you a retro or ghostly glamour. These beginner customisations will cost you around Tk 10,000.
You also have the option to customise the turn signals. The built-in ones usually stick out and are not all that flashy. Installing a custom LED signal will ensure that it's visible from a distance, in addition to fitting in well with the custom body modifications that you have just added.
A more practical customisation is the Fender Eliminator kit. The fenders that come on new motorcycles are bulky, ugly, and generally ruin the appearance of a motorcycle, and their elimination gives you a slim and edgy look that young riders appreciate. On top of that, the eliminator kit ensures that the rear light and turn lights are fit properly.


If you are more concerned about performance, your focus should be on mods like air filters and suspensions. Standard filters will certainly do the job but a performance air filter will ensure that your engine can get more air for combustion, thus boosting its performance. They might be a bit expensive, but their performance output will be more than worth it.
Performance suspensions on the other hand, which are configured to your specifications will improve the bike's handling, responsiveness, braking and overall ride quality.
However, it is very important to note that a number of engine and muffler customisations are not permitted, and therefore might get you into trouble with the police, which is why it is highly recommended that you consult a licensed mechanic before modding your bike. They will have all the information you need.


Adding a frame slider and an engine guard is as good idea as any. The engine guards are basically a bar of steel that separate the engine from the ground. In case of a crash, it ensures that there are no scratches or heavy brunt on the engine. A frame slider on the other hand, are small devices on the sides that are similar to roll bars. They keep the frame away from the ground in the event that the bike tips over.
If you want to really spice it up, you should go for a customised fork. But remember, this will not only change the overall look of the bike, it will also change the performance and the balance of the vehicle.
Last but not least, are the tyres, seats and handlebars. Leather accessories might look good, but the lighter ones will also scratch easily and will require regular conditioning treatment. Tyres will not only change the look, but will directly influence the balance and performance, as tires dictate how much grip your bike has with the road. Always choose tyres that support the terrain you drive on. Avoid tyres that do not properly fit with your wheels since they will affect the handling.
And remember, safety should always be a priority, even with mods.

I wonder, are skirts the unsung heroes of our wardrobes? Sure, we love the freedom, privacy, and cool factor a pair of jeans brings, but the skirt has some much sartorial versatility to offer.

","From the land of saris and longer kurtas, it's a no-brainer that skirts would be a natural derivative of east-western fusion wear. I wonder, are skirts the unsung heroes of our wardrobes? Sure, we love the freedom, privacy, and cool factor a pair of jeans brings, but the skirt has some much sartorial versatility to offer.
Whether it's mini or maxi, simple or printed, the summer staple can be updated with tights or leggings for winter style, or just topped with any white or black tee to take an outfit to next-level chicness.
Like the short kurta, the skirt fits in the spectrum between Eastern and Western wear. Yet, we are still toeing the hem, and many of us wonder if it would be too bold.
""I love wearing skirts,"" says Anika, a 25-year-old student, ""but I always feel like I'm getting extra stares, as if I'm wearing something really revealing!""
The enigma and objectification of the wardrobe item is starting to wear off, and the skirt getting its due place among us — an awesome fusion piece that offers a range of versatility, whether you like a little bit of flaunt or you prefer modest fashion.
""I have pictures of my grandmother wearing long skirts with a simple blouse during her younger years,"" she added. ""But clearly, even I had reservations about donning it!""
Over the pandemic lockdown, the trend of the skirt is making waves across homes.
""Since I've been staying at home completely, I've been more into experimenting with the items in my wardrobe that I didn't wear out that much,"" says Nabila, a 30-year-old development worker.
""I'd wear skirts at home that I'd bought during my travels, but never wear outside. The long skirts I used to buy from New Market are so comfortable for working and chilling at home. It reminds me of my mum or grandmother relaxing in their kurta and petticoat on hot, humid days,"" she added.


So are skirts making their way back into acceptable wear?
""I used to wear skirts before the lockdown to class as well and so did a lot of my friends,"" says Anika. ""Maybe post-lockdown, society will be less obsessed with how we cover our legs!""
One of the best features of the skirt is versatility and how one can achieve a lot of different looks based on how they feel like pairing it! I'm all about functionality and fusion, and it looks like the wardrobe comeback is embracing that too!
Flowy and cotton

We already named it! Since it's the summer months, the easiest pairing would be cotton skirt. The fabric works best for our weather, and you will feel like a bohemian princess doing your house work while being extra comfy in the warm months.
Floral
It's always floral season in Bangladesh, and they're always pretty and funky. By far, florals are the most popular summer print. You can choose a long skirt or midi, and dress it up with a single coloured silk or chiffon blouse, or dress it down with plain t-shirts and sneakers.
Plaid
Long associated with either the '90s grunge scene or dry academic garb, the plaid has made quite the comeback since the last few seasons. They look great as skirts. Go grunge, or go posh, or even low-key with the plain tee.
Fusion prints
Deshi fabric and embroidery on western wear is back! Actually, were they ever really gone? You can't go wrong with beautiful hand embroidery and block print motifs. Choose a long flowy skirt if you like the bohemian vibe, or a crop skirt for a stylish, unique fusion look.

","Paris St Germain believe they can learn from their run to the Champions League final and become European champions after coming closer than ever in Sunday's 1-0 loss to Bayern Munich.
The French champions were left to pay the price for failing to convert the opportunities that came their way -- Neymar was notably denied by a fine Manuel Neuer save early on, but Kylian Mbappe really should have done better than shoot straight at the goalkeeper just before half-time.
""We have to create a great team to follow up on this campaign. That's our challenge,"" coach Thomas Tuchel said. ""I'm going to talk with (sporting director) Leonardo and the people in charge to create that team.""
""Over the last few weeks we have shown everything you need to win every title going,"" Tuchel added.""We lost 1-0 in the final against one of the strongest sides in Europe. We must maintain the same quality to carry on this road.""
""Right now it's difficult to sleep, it's difficult to speak, it's difficult to explain,"" added midfielder Ander Herrera. ""But, from tomorrow we're going to start again. We've built something very, very important.""
""I had a feeling the first goal would decide the final. I'm disappointed but not too much. We were very, very close. What did we need to win? The first goal,"" Tuchel said. The two most expensive players in football history were signed, ultimately, to win this game. It was not their night, and Neymar was in tears. ""Inconsolable"" was the headline on the front page of sports daily L'Equipe on Monday, underneath a photo of the Brazilian crying.
""Neymar has had a great tournament, he cannot do everything,"" the German said.
""We're a team, it's not any individual's fault,"" added midfielder Marquinhos. ""We have to be proud of our team. Nobody thought we'd do that well in this campaign."

","When Hansi Flick took over struggling Bayern Munich in November 2019 the media headlines declared that teams should no longer fear the German champions,  but outstanding teamwork and a hunger for victory turned the season around, the coach said on Sunday.
""I am proud of this team,"" a beaming Flick told reporters. ""When I started in November I read the headlines: 'No need to fear or respect Bayern Munich anymore', 'The team is awful.""
""But the development of my team since then has been sensational. We made maximum use of everything. It is not easy to win three titles,"" he added.
Flick replaced Niko Kovac in November after a 5-1 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt and with Bayern having dropped out of the top three in the Bundesliga. But the former Germany assistant coach instantly turned the campaign on its head, leading Bayern to an unbeaten 2020 in every competition.
""It's such a huge joy, it feels like we have come a long way since November,"" said Mueller, who was a peripheral figure under Kovac. ""I don't know how it looked from outside, but it felt like we deserved it in the way we played.""
They have won 21 consecutive matches in all competitions and are on a 30-game unbeaten run. The Bavarians won every Champions League game this season - including a memorable 8-2 demolition of Barcelona in the quarterfinals - becoming the first side to do so.
""The team is always in the foreground,"" Flick said. ""When you see how we worked until the 96th minute tonight in defence then it is a superb team spirit. Every player developed in such a way so as to win three titles. This only happens as a team.""
Flick is the third coach in the last decade to win the Champions League having being appointed during a campaign, after Roberto di Matteo with Chelsea in 2011/12 and Zinedine Zidane with Real Madrid in 2015/16.
But, as Thomas Mueller described, it was also 'brutal' mental strength and focus that saw them through.
""We kept marching on this season, we were there for each other, ready to correct each other's mistakes,"" said attacking midfielder Thomas Mueller, benched by Kovac but sensational under Flick.
""We have amazing quality but it does not work if you are not ready to suffer. Our mental strength is brutal.""
""This is not the start of a new era,"" said retired former Bayern captain Mark van Bommel. ""This process has been going on since 2010 and new players keep coming in as the older leave but the success remains."""

","Bangladesh, along with rest of the world, has been facing unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This crisis in general the lockdown and restrictions associated with it, have had a gendered impact, affecting vulnerable women and girls disproportionately. Different forms of violence against women like dowry-related incidents, acid attacks, rape and others have significantly increased during this pandemic. In a statement issued on 6 April 2020, the Executive Director of UN Women has termed the violence against women as a shadow pandemic. In this backdrop, Law & Our Rights, The Daily Star invited a panel of experts to shed light on the shortcomings of the existing laws and policies pertaining to violence against women and share their recommendations for the stakeholders. Emraan Azad, from The Daily Star and also a Lecturer in Law, Bangladesh University of Professionals, moderated the discussion.
Taslima Yasmin 

Assistant Professor, Department of Law, University of Dhaka
Bangladesh has ratified an array of international human rights instruments such as ICCPR, ICESCR, CEDAW, etc. We are obligated under the international instruments to take appropriate measures to reduce and prevent violence against women and girls. On a national level, we have different laws which have been enacted as a response to the rising incidents of violence against women. Bangladesh has enacted two different special legislations to tackle acid violence. Punishments for rape has been raised in the Nari O Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain 2000 and laws have been enacted regarding domestic violence as well. Although the laws appear to be sufficient, they have many loopholes and therefore they do not adequately provide redress to the victims.
When these laws get implemented, their inherent inadequacies become apparent. It is important to ask whether the stakeholders have been sufficiently consulted and whether their consultations have been incorporated in the laws. We also need to pay attention to whether the implementing stakeholders have the necessary knowledge and training. The patriarchal premise permeating different sectors of society creates manifold obstacles in attaining justice for the women; this, among others, also needs to be taken into consideration. We are lagging in ensuring capacity-building and gender-sensitisation among the enforcement bodies. Our policies do not prioritise these issues; the national emergency response to COVID-19 also does not sufficiently address the needs of women and girls.
Rina Roy

Programme Director, Manusher Jonno Foundation
Manusher Jonno Foundation conducted a telephonic survey from April to July 2020. In July, about sixty-three thousand women were contacted and it was found that besides an increase in domestic violence, there has also been a rise in violence against child workers. The informal sector had collapsed during the first two months of the lockdown, but they slowly opened up again in July - as a result, more children are being sent to work as domestic aides. The social insecurity, poverty and the closing down of schools have exacerbated the crisis and have led to a rise in child marriage as well. Instances of marital rape have also gone up.
Our field-level workers are in regular contact with many women and based on our mandate, we have maintained such correspondence to try and keep track of the condition of women across the country. Our staff has also attempted to provide counselling to women over telephone. While there are many challenges and drawbacks of  telephone surveys, we consider such correspondence to be a manifestation of our mandate in terms of supporting  them in a situation where their access to traditional social-support systems and legal redress has largely been restricted, due to the unprecedented crisis.
Dr. Sayed Saikh Imtiaz 

Former Chairman, Department of Women and Gender Studies, University of Dhaka
As researchers, we must be cautious about collecting information through digital/telephonic surveys. We need to be mindful of whether the interviewees will be subjected to newer and additional violence due to their participation. Most of the perpetrators of such violence are intimate family members, and the international community has reiterated the need for such cautiousness.
We need to increase implementation of research and identify whether the implementation mechanisms of the government, such as the One-stop Crisis Centre (OCC), is working properly. In cases of crisis, when the usual social-support resources collapse, we need to identify what alternative social-support mechanisms can be resorted to.
Women's access to menstrual hygiene and contraception is also a significant area that we need to address. Our research focus can be shifted to these areas. We should also include and analyse the key drivers for the perpetrators in our research and try to find out the factors behind the increased incidence of violence, among other things. Our prevention measures should focus on possible perpetrators and include men and boys in awareness raising activities.
Dr. Faustina Pereira

Head, Legal Empowerment and Sustainable Development, Center for Peace and Justice, BRAC University
Before the pandemic, the UN women's surveys showed that 1 in 3 women has been subjected to violence, but this has intensified since the pandemic has started. 15% of women who had never been subjected to violence before, have been victims of violence during the pandemic. Children, elder people, differently abled people, and domestic workers also reside in the marginalised section within families. Rates of pregnancy have also gone up – we cannot but ponder whether it is entirely resultant of consensual sexual relations.
When we discuss the matters of violence against women and girls, we look largely towards the contribution of non-state actors, i.e. NGOs. In case of lawlessness in public sectors, we look to the state but in case of private incidents like domestic violence, we do not automatically look at the state – which is where in fact the primary responsibility lies. From the month of March to July, the access to justice in case of violence against women and girls was restricted. Women were told to show a COVID-19 negative certificate before providing them shelters. Many OCCs have been converted to COVID-19 treatment facilities. As a result, it has become paramount that we question the adequacy of the state's actions in this regard.
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) can act proactively while still staying within its mandate; for example, many states have recognised domestic violence as a 'shadow pandemic' in their national strategies and plans of actions. Nothing similar has been done in Bangladesh. Many research works have shown that domestic violence has a great economic cost. According to conservative estimates, a country loses about 2.5% of its GDP due to domestic violence. We expect the NHRC to push the government to undertake necessary policy measures and make proper budgetary allocation for domestic violence prevention.
Dr. Nomita Halder, ndc 

Member, National Human Rights Commission
The NHRC has expressed its concerns regarding the rise in violence against women. The NHRC acts as a bridge between the government and the people; it cannot provide redress independently. The government and concerned ministries are to provide the necessary assistance to the victims through legislative and policy measures. The NHRC's dedicated team is active and has maintained correspondence with relevant stakeholders amid the pandemic.
The NHRC has many constraints – it works with limited resources to tackle a wide variety of issues. However, it is providing legal assistance to women through its panel lawyers. We have several national strategies and action plans that address violence against women. The NHRC has also addressed the relevant ministry to restrict the provision of relief measures to those who have been identified as perpetrators of domestic violence. However, we need to change the mindset of the society before we can properly implement the rights women are entitled to under the existing laws.

","Marred by poor response from listed millers and with the closing deadline for the government's Boro rice procurement programme only a few days away, the programme is destined for a massive shortfall in target procurement this year in Pabna.
The rice procurement drive in Pabna started on May 7 and it is set to end on August 31. This year the government set a target of procuring 24,571 metric tonnes of rice from 682 listed rice mills through 11 designated procurement centres in the district.
But, as of August 15, only 9,800 tonnes, which is less than half the target, of rice was purchased at the procurement centres.
While some are pointing out that steep prices of rice, at retail markets, might be one of the reasons behind the deficit, many others are blaming it on the role of a group of rice traders and millers with vested interest.
But on whomever the blame is put, the situation might lead to a massive shortage in the food grain stock of the government, said many stakeholders.
Rice millers and traders said many of the listed millers might have felt discouraged to sell the grain to the government as the former have been able to sell it at retail markets for prices much higher than that set by the government.       
But whatever the reason might be, more than a third of the listed millers have so far refrained from selling even one bag of rice to the government, according to food officials.  
Iqbal Bahar, controller of food in Pabna, said over two hundred millers, most of who own large-scale rice mills and under contract with the government, did not sell a single bag of rice to the government after the drive started.
Although the food controller's office served numerous notices on them in this regard, many of the millers are yet to comply, he added.
Out of the total procurement target of 24,571 tonnes, 15,162 tonnes of rice was set to be procured from Ishwardi, an upazila considered to be the largest rice hub in the region. 
Till August 15, only 6,402 tonnes of rice was procured at procurement centres in the upazila. As opposed to the paddy procurement target of 6,695 tonnes, only 582 tonnes was procured in the upazila till the same date.
Asked about the reasons behind the poor response, Fazlur Rahman Malitha, president of rice mill owners' association in the upazila, said out of all the upazilas in the northern region, they had been selling the highest amount of rice to the government.
But this year, the millers from Ishwardi have felt disappointment and thus refrained from selling rice to the government as the procurement rates set by the latter are too low -- only Tk 36 for one kilogram of rice and Tk 26 for paddy.
At retail markets, each kg of rice can be sold for more than Tk 40 against its production cost of Tk 38 to Tk 39, while a kg of paddy can be sold there for more than Tk 28. These are the main reasons that made the millers to turn away from government procurement centres, Fazlur added.  
In response to the possibility of raising the rates, Iqbal Bahar, the food controller in Pabna, said there was no scope of raising the procurement rates at the moment as a market survey was conducted prior to setting those rates. 
Stern action would be taken against the listed millers for their breach of contract, under which they are required to sell the produce at rates set by the government, he added. 
On how to tackle a probable shortage in food grain stock of the government, he said there would be no shortage in food grain as the government might import rice if the rice procurement drive fails."

","President Vladimir Putin said yesterday that Russia had become the first country in the world to grant regulatory approval to a Covid-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing, a move hailed by Moscow as evidence of its scientific prowess.
The vaccine still has to complete final trials, raising concerns among some experts at the speed of its approval, but the Russian business conglomerate Sistema has said it expects to put it into mass production by the end of the year.
Russian health workers treating Covid-19 patients will be offered the chance of volunteering to be vaccinated in the coming weeks, a source told Reuters last month.
Regulatory approval paves the way for the mass inoculation of the Russian population and authorities hope it will allow the economy, which has been battered by fallout from the virus, to return to full capacity.
Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, hailed the development as a historic ""Sputnik moment"", comparable to the Soviet Union's 1957 launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first satellite.
The vaccine will be marketed under the name 'Sputnik V' on foreign markets, he said.
Dmitriev said Russia had already received foreign requests for 1 billion doses. International agreements had been secured to produce 500 million doses annually, with the vaccine also expected to be produced in Brazil.
He said clinical trials were expected to start soon in the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines.
But only about 10% of clinical trial are successful, and the speed at which Russia has moved, approving a vaccine before the final stages of trials to test safety and efficacy are over, has worried some scientists, who fear Moscow may be putting national prestige before safety.
Speaking at a government meeting on state television, Putin dismissed those concerns, saying the vaccine, developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute, was safe and that it had even been administered to one of his daughters.
""I know that it works quite effectively, forms strong immunity, and I repeat, it has passed all the needed checks,"" said Putin.
He said he hoped mass production would start soon.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and Russian health authorities are discussing the process for possible WHO prequalification for its newly approved Covid-19 vaccine, a WHO spokesman said yesterday.
""We are in close contact with Russian health authorities and discussions are ongoing with respect to possible WHO prequalification of the vaccine, but again prequalification of any vaccine includes the rigorous review and assessment of all required safety and efficacy data,"" WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told a UN briefing in Geneva, referring to clinical trials.
PHASE III TRIAL
The vaccine's approval by the Russian health ministry comes before the start of a larger trial involving thousands of participants, commonly known as a Phase III trial.
Such trials, which require a certain rate of participants catching the virus to observe the vaccine's effect, are normally considered essential precursors for a vaccine to receive regulatory approval.
The Moscow-based Association of Clinical Trials Organizations (ACTO), a trade body representing the world's top drugmakers in Russia this week urged the health ministry to postpone approval until that final trial had been successfully completed.
In a letter to the ministry, it said there were high risks associated with registering a drug before that happened.
""It is during this phase that the main evidence of a vaccine's efficacy is collected, as well as information on adverse reactions that could appear in certain groups of patients: people with weakened immunity, people with concomitant diseases and so forth,"" it said.
Some international experts have also questioned the speed at which Russia approved its vaccine.
""Normally you need a large number of people to be tested before you approve a vaccine,"" said Peter Kremsner from the University Hospital in Tuebingen, currently testing CureVac's Covid-19 vaccine in clinical trials.
""In that respect, I think it's reckless to do that (approve it) if lots of people haven't already been tested.""
Duncan Matthews, a professor of intellectual property law at Queen Mary University of London, said news of a potential Covid-19 vaccine was to be welcomed, ""but safety must be the priority"".
""The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have fast-track approval procedures for emergency humanitarian use and we need to see evidence that Russia is adopting an equally prudent approach,"" Matthews said in an emailed comment.
More than 100 possible vaccines are being developed around the world to try to stop the Covid-19 pandemic. At least four are in final Phase III human trials, according to WHO data."

Shamim, who was stationed with the Narayanganj Sadar Police Station, is now attached at the city's Masdah Police Line as per the order of the District Superintendent of Police (SP) Jayedul Alam, our local correspondent reported quoting the SP.
SP Jayedul told The Daily Star that SI Shamim was closed for fair investigation as a probe is underway against him.
Meanwhile, Abdul Hai, inspector (operation) of Narayanganj Sadar Police Station, was made the new IO of the case.
SP Jayedul, however, said they need time to complete the investigation.
Amjat Hossain, father of Md Abdullah, one of the accused in the case, said a conspiracy was hatched to implicate his son and two others in a false case.
He demanded that the mastermind of the incident be identified.
On August 25, the father of the girl sought the release of the three accused persons who are in jail in connection with an abduction case filed over his daughter's disappearance, as he got his daughter back alive the previous day.
Addressing a press briefing on that day, Narayanganj Additional Superintendent of Police (administration) Mostafizur Rahman said, ""Today, we know that the girl was not raped. The girl met one of the three accused on the day of the incident. Later in the night, she fled with a man named Iqbal,"" the police official said, adding the two got married and began living in a rented house in Bandar Kushiyara area.
The husband was arrested for marrying an underage girl, police said.
The family members of the accused have been claiming that police had beaten their sons in remand and forced them to make their confessional statement. Police, however, denied the allegation.
About two weeks after her disappearance on July 4, her mother lodged a general diary (GD) with the Narayanganj Sadar Model Police Station on July 17.
On August 6, her father filed an abduction case with the police station. Later, the police arrested three youths after tracking the call list of the girl's mother.
On August 9, the accused testified under Section 164 in separate courts of Narayanganj Senior Judicial Magistrate and Judicial Magistrate. In their confessional statement, the accused said that they had killed the girl after raping her and threw her body in the Shitalakkhya river, said police.
After their confessional statement, the accused were sent to jail. Since then, the trio -- Md Abdullah, 22, Md Rakib, 19, and Khalilur Rahman, 36, -- have been in jail.
The girl later called her mother asking for money. That is when police were alerted and they went and found the girl."

""Many people want to say many things about the formulation of the Six-point Demand. But, I know personally that it (Six-point Demand) was solely the outcome of Bangabandhu's thoughts,"" she told the prize-distribution ceremony of an online quiz competition marking the historic Six-point Demand Day.
Bangabandhu's birth centenary celebration national implementation committee organised the ceremony at the International Mother Language Institute (IMLI) while the premier joined it from her official residence Gono Bhaban through a videoconference.
Speaking at the function as chief guest, the premier recalled that Mohammad Hanif (former mayor of Dhaka City Corporation) knew this as he typed the Six-point Demand when he was a personal assistant of Bangabandhu in Alfa Insurance Company where the Father of the Nation joined in 1960 to mainly maintain communication with his party leaders and activists.
""Bangabandhu always used to write down what he thought (about the Six-point Demand) and used to give it to Hanif to type those. And only Hanif knew that the Six-point Demand was solely coming out from the thought of Bangabandhu as he had typed it. No one else knew that,"" she said.
Highlighting the background of formulation of the Six-point Demand, the premier said that during the Indo-Pak war in 1965, the people of then East Pakistan remained unprotected as there was no importance to the central government of Pakistan for protecting this region.
""We remained unprotected (during the Indo-Pakistan war). So, Bangabandhu took the decision to formulate the Six-point Demand,"" she said.
The premier said the Six-point Demand that had proposed to give autonomy to every province of Pakistan was adopted at the working committee of the Awami League and subsequently passed by the party's national congress.
She mentioned that Bangabandhu later took initiatives to publicise the Six-point Demand across the country and started holding meetings one after another.
""Bangabandhu was arrested time and again and implicated in cases in every district where he went to arrange meetings in favour of the demand,"" the premier said.
Sheikh Hasina, elder daughter of Bangabandhu, said when Bangabandhu returned to Dhaka after staging the last meeting at Adamjinagar, Narayanganj on Six-point Demand, police arrested him from their Dhanmondi residence.
""Not only Bangabandhu, numerous party leaders were picked up by the police, and protesting it, the people launched a massive movement across the country,"" she added.
State Minister for the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology Zunaid Ahmed Palak and Bangabandhu's birth centenary celebration national implementation committee Chief Coordinator Dr Kamal Abul Naser Chowdhury gave welcome address at the function.
Chairman of Bangabandhu's birth centenary celebration national implementation committee National Professor Dr Rafiqul Islam, who gave vote of thanks, handed over cheques and certificates signed by the premier among first three winners of the competition on behalf of the PM.
The participants of the competition including 100 winners got connected from 35 offices of deputy commissioners (DCs) across the country.
A total of 1,09,929 participants from across the country took part in the competition.
Of the participants, the first prize winner of the quiz competition, Imtiaz Pasha, a student of Public Administration Department of Dhaka University, and the fifth prize winner, Khuku Rani, a teacher of Khulna Railway Girls School, shared their experiences with the audiences on behalf of the participants."

","A parliamentary watchdog today formed a sub-committee to investigate the alleged corruption in purchasing books for setting up Bangabandhu Corner at all government primary schools.
The parliamentary standing committee on primary and mass education has asked the four-member sub-committee -- headed by Awami League MP Nazrul Islam Babu from Narayanganj-2 -- to submit its report within one month.
Three other members of the sub-committee are: AL MP Ali Azam from Bhola-2, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal MP Shirin Akhter from Feni-1 and BNP MP Mosharraf Hossain from Bogura-4.
At the beginning of the meeting held at the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, a number of MPs including Shirin Akhtar and Mosharraf Hossain mentioned the alleged irregularities in purchasing books for Bangabandhu Corner at around 65,000 primary schools across the country.
They demanded that the parliamentary body form an investigation committee to enquire into the matter and identify persons involved in the corruption. Other members of the committee also supported the proposal, sources at the meeting said.
AL MP Mostafizur Rahman, chief of the parliamentary watchdog, then formed the sub-committee to enquire into the alleged corruption.
Talking to The Daily Star over phone, Mostafizur Rahman said Tk 150 crore was allocated to purchase 30 different books on Bangabandhu to set up Bangabandhu Corner at all government primary schools.
""Different media outlets recently reported that widespread corruption has taken place in purchasing of those books. It was reported that those books were purchased at high prices compared to their original prices. We have asked the sub-committee to enquire and reveal the truth,"" added Mostafizur.
He said the standing committee has also asked secretary to the primary and mass education ministry to submit a detailed report on the purchasing process before the committee's next meeting.
Mostafizur Rahman said allegations have also been raised that copyright act has been violated while reprinting of two books on Bangabandhu.
Allegations were raised against a senior reporter of a private television channel that he has violated the copyright act while re-printing and delivering of those two books for Bangabandhu Corner."

Businessman Jasim Uddin lodged a complaint with the court of Chattogram Metropolitan Magistrate Abu Salem Md Noman today against 13 persons including nine policemen.
Taking the complaint into cognizance, the court ordered the deputy commissioner (Detective Branches-North) of Chattogram Metropolitan Police (CMP) to investigate the role of seven accused -- including Liaqat -- out of 13 people, said the plaintiff lawyer Jewel Das.
The six other accused are Cumilla's Daudkandi Police Station Sub-Inspector (SI) Nazrul, former SI Hannan, SM Sahabuddin, Bishnupad Palit, Kajol Kanti Baidya and Ziaur Rahman.
SI Nazrul has been attached at Satkania police station of Chattogram while Sahabuddin, Bishnupad, Kajol and Ziaur Rahman are the business rivals of the plaintiff, said the lawyer.
Jasim, the owner of Suchana Enterprise in the city's Sagarika BISIC area, told our Chattogram correspondent that he had filed a case over burglary and looting in his office in 2014. SI Liaqat Ali was the Investigation Officer (IO) of the case. Liaqat took Tk 50,000 from him during the investigation.""
""On 14, 2014, I was called at the Laldighi DB office and was requested to compromise the case there. When I denied, they (the accused) demanded Tk 5 lakh and tortured me in the office,"" he said.
Jasim claimed SI Liaqat detained him in the Patenga police station premises and demanded the money while threatening to kill him in crossfire.
Jasim claimed that he gave Tk 2 lakh to SI Liaqat to save his own life. Despite giving him the money, the SI later took him to Sadarghat Police Station and showed him arrested in an extortion case filed with the police station.
""I was sent to jail in the case and came out of bail after 19 days,"" he added."

Messi's buy-out clause stands at an astronomical figure of 700m euros but the exit clause could see him leave for free.
""I ask you please and I ask you on my knees on behalf of millions of fans, I don't know if [Josep Maria] Bartomeu and [Ronald] Koeman have gotten on their knees, but if you don't listen to me, there is a contract and conditions, not a single euro should be forgiven . Once he is asked, if he wants to go, he can only accept the 700 million clause,"" he said in an interview in Mediaset, echoing what appears to be the sentiment of the current Barcelona board.
Gaspart claims that he has seen Messi's contract and says the clause expired in June. However, the season only technically ended for Barcelona following the Champions League final on August 23rd. If however Messi stays, he can leave for free when his contract expires next season. Gaspart, who had overseen some of the most disastrous management decisions in the club's history -- including selling Brazilian forward Ronaldo after a year -- says it is better to keep Messi for now then to let him leave for anything below 700m euros.
""Messi cannot leave. He will leave in 2021. I have seen the contract and it is very clear. The clause ended in June and there is no going back. I prefer the next year for his departure when he can leave for free then to see him go for anything less than 700 million. The club is in charge here, not the player. The club has paid the players. And this is not a matter of money, besides, here is a signed contract and that's it,"" Gaspart said."

Messi asked Barca Tuesday to leave the club he has been with for 20 seasons, since he was 13 years old.
""Messi has not informed us that he was not going to show up to training,"" Planes said during the official unveiling of Portuguese striker Joao Trincao.
""But all exchanges will remain between the two parties (the club and the player) and out of respect we will not communicate on what is said because we are putting all our efforts in this dialogue.""
Planes took over his post from Eric Abidal, who was sacked a day after manager Quique Setien was released following the humiliating 8-2 Champions League quarter-final defeat by Bayern Munich, which left Barca without a trophy for the first time since 2007.
Messi, Planes insisted, in the first official club reaction to the Argentinian's want-away demand, was ""important news. But what we think, and we've said it many times, is that we see Messi as a Barca player"".
""Today Trincao arrives and we hope he will triumph alongside Messi.""
Planes added: ""Barca has rebuilt itself several times in its history, and it has always come back more powerful. Our idea is to do it once again, around the best player in the world.
""You have to have enormous respect for what Messi is and for his history.
""We're not thinking about any clause in his contract. Messi's marriage to Barca has brought a lot to both (the club and the player), a lot of joy to the supporters and, internally, we are working to convince Messi to find the best solution for Barca and for Messi.""
Planes stressed that there was ""not an argument between Messi and Barca - neither deserves it"".
""We are working to make Barca a winner. There is no division within the club over Leo. Anyone who knows football wants him to stay here to win again. He's a winner."""

The Fitbit Sense, priced at $329, replaces the Ionic as the 13-year-old company's most expensive smartwatch, excluding a limited edition model. It also is the first to measure electrodermal activity, or how well skin conducts electricity, which varies with sweating and can indicate stress. The feature is pending approval from health regulators.
Fitbit research scientist Samy Abdel-Ghaffar said a new stress score would help users decide whether to take on a fresh project or instead take a break, sleep early or meditate.
The company also announced the Versa 3 smartwatch, priced at $229 and upgraded from its predecessor to include a GPS sensor and phone-calling functionality; and the Inspire 2 activity tracker, running $100 with a tweaked design.
The devices ship in late September, with pre-orders available immediately.
The company has lost wearables market share to Apple Inc and others since going public five years ago. Fitbit announced last week that a new content subscription to stoke revenue growth has 500,000 paying users, but shares barely moved.
About 5% of wearables shipped last year globally came from Fitbit, behind leader Apple's 32% share, according to tracker IDC.
Aiming to challenge Apple together, Google agreed to buy Fitbit for $2.1 billion last November. But competition regulators in the UK, United States and many other jurisdictions are weighing whether the acquisition would unfairly deepen Google's data about users' habits. Fitbit said the reviews may delay closing the deal to 2021.
Meanwhile, Google and Fitbit are partnering. Sense and Versa 3 by late this year will allow users to communicate with the Google Assistant helper, similar to Fitbit's existing integration with Amazon.com Inc's Alexa."

The reality of these JDCs, as perhaps one would expect, is pretty different.","Children, like adults, can get embroiled in conflicts with the law. When juveniles commit criminal offences, they are placed in Juvenile Development Centres (JDC) rather than jails, where constructive counselling is supposed to be provided so that they realise their mistakes and come out of these centres better human beings. The reality of these JDCs, as perhaps one would expect, is pretty different.
The recent grisly murder of three young boys in the Jashore Juvenile Development Centre has brought into limelight the country's struggles with ensuring protection of child offenders in the so-called juvenile correction centres. Naeem Hossain, Parvez Hasan Rabbi and Rasel alias Sujon—three juvenile inmates of the Jashore JDC, along with some other inmates—were tortured by the officials and other inmates of the JDC so brutally that they succumbed to the injuries on the same day. Their mouths were stuffed with towels and hands were pulled out of the iron bars, while they were being beaten with cricket stumps, rods and sticks. The pain was so brutal that these boys were said to have fainted. And when they regained consciousness, they were subjected to a fresh round of beating. And why? According to media reports, apparently one of the boys—Hridoy, who also happens to be a barber—failed to comply with the correction centre's head of security Nur Islam's order to cut his hair, which led to two bouts of scuffles—the second leading to the death of the three juvenile inmates, triggering public wrath.
This, however, is not the first such incident of atrocity committed in a correction facility. Earlier, in 2011, an inmate was brutally murdered at a correction centre. And cases of suicide are not uncommon. In 2013, Monira Begum chose suicide over living at the Gazipur correction centre. Even as recently as 2019, a 15-year-old boy Noor Islam committed suicide in one of the centres. One can only imagine what circumstances lead to such desperate actions by these youths.
The pictures of the three JDC in the country that are now surfacing through media investigations tell us a lot about what happens behind the iron gates of these ""correction"" facilities.
These centres are no less of a prison than prisons for adults. These overcrowded places—according to media reports, these centres run at overcapacity, at times accommodating more than 900 inmates in 300 capacity facilities—are neither able to provide the children with adequate food and essentials, nor are they able to ensure satisfactory psychological counselling to address their emotional needs. Worst of all, these centres seem to be run by people who treat these juveniles as criminals and are prone to meting out harsh punishments, as happened on August 13 at the Jashore JDC.
An investigative report published by a local English daily suggests that these correction centres lack proper counselling teams or even proper doctors. For a long time, these centres were even lacking in instructors for physically or mentally challenged children. Due to lack of care, planning and supervision, neither proper counselling nor physiological training are provided to these children. And who are to be blamed for this? The local ""caretakers"" or the system that allows the appointment of sadistic, myopic and careless officials for the important task of caring for misguided children?
Given the realities, one might be pardoned for questioning the willingness of the concerned authorities to address the plight of child offenders. Why did it take the murder of three boys for the Ministry of Social Welfare to form a probe body to identify the criminals or even acknowledge the crime? When was the last time the concerned authorities paid visits to these JDCs to see for themselves how the misguided children of this nation are being ""corrected"" in the development centres? Perhaps the murder of one, or the occasional suicide of lone juveniles, could not generate enough public attention to engage them.
Children, especially the ones in their adolescence, can become derailed for various reasons. Last year, I wrote a column that took a closer look at the causes behind the growing problem of juvenile delinquency. While eliminating reasons that lead children to come into conflict with the law remains a priority for all; for the ones who are already on the wrong side of it, these correctional facilities can play a significant role in giving them a second chance at life.
Child psychologist Tarana Anis says that juvenile development centres are not only meant to help the derailed children and youth understand the mistakes they have made, the crimes they have committed, and enable them to correct their ways through psychological counselling. These centres are also supposed to explore the triggers that led them to commit crimes and address those factors. She said, ""Adolescents can become engaged in criminal activities for many reasons, it is the responsibility of the correction facilities to understand case-by-case what pushed them to this path, help them overcome those triggers.""
""In fact, if possible, child offenders should be allowed to stay in the comfort of their homes, amidst the love and care of their families. Clinical social workers can be engaged to provide them with psychological counselling and emotional support to help them rise above the challenges. Regular psychological monitoring combined with healthy physiological training can play an important role in enabling these children move forward in life, while living with their families. The idea is to allow these children to leave their past behind and move forward in life, not the other way round.""
With regard to the individuals appointed in various roles in the JDCs, Tarana said, ""Dealing with disturbed children can be an overwhelming task, even for child psychologists. The people who are being appointed in these important roles should have in-depth understanding about child psychology; or at least these individuals should be given regular training and counselling in handling traumatised children.""
The responsibility for disturbed juveniles should not be left in the hands of sadistic individuals who take pleasure in inflicting pain on helpless children. These development centres have been established to correct the ways and world views of child offenders by providing them with psychological training, and integrate them into mainstream social and economic activities by providing them with skills development training, rather than breeding violence-hardened criminals, as the three JDCs in the country are currently doing.
While the concerned authorities are investigating the specific case at Jashore JDC, the higher authorities must now take a serious look into how these incidents of mismanagement and cruelty were allowed to continue for so long. Bangladesh, as one of the earliest signatories to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), is expected to be a model for many other countries to follow.
The country and its administration must do all it can to uphold the rights of its children. Offender or not, every children has the right to protection and care and under no circumstances should these be compromised. The culprits, not only in Jashore JDC, but in the form of a system that looks the other way, should be brought to justice for the gruesome murder of the three boys—for subjecting their wards to pain, trauma and cruelty.
Let's not forget, by allowing a situation where a child needs to be put in a JDC, we have already failed them as a society. The failure to ensure their basic safety at these JDCs is worse by many orders of magnitude. 
For these delinquent youths, we have JDCs. What do we have for a delinquent society?

","Bangladesh is a service sector led economy, where 52.8 percent of the GDP comes from the service sector, followed by 29.6 percent from industry and 12.6 percent from agriculture. Since independence, the contribution of agriculture to GDP has been decreasing with time. That does not mean that the volume of agriculture production or its significance is reducing, rather that the GDP of Bangladesh is increasing at a faster rate than the rate of growth of the agriculture sector. Currently, the Bangladesh agriculture sector is producing 38.7 million metric tonnes (MMT) of rice and 1.25 MMT of wheat against its annual demand of 32 MMT of rice and 5.5 MMT of wheat. While our rice production is enough to meet local demand, the additional demand for wheat is usually met through imports.
This year, Covid-19 has hit the economy hard. In the over two months of ""general holiday"" (lockdown), the poverty rate has increased, standing at 35 percent in June 2020, compared to 24.3 percent in 2016, according to the Centre for Policy Dialogue. In the households stricken by poverty during the pandemic, income earnings and savings have come to a standstill. According to a recent study, the Covid-19 pandemic has potentially reduced average monthly income of lower income groups from Tk 15,000 per month to Tk 3,700 per month.
A significant number of expatriate worker's families have also suffered huge losses in their fixed income from remittances in the last few months, since many expatriate workers are under lockdown in host countries and are not being able to earn, and many more have lost their jobs and have been forced to return home. As a result, the purchasing power of these families have been significantly reduced as well. Therefore, the question of food security in Bangladesh is not a matter of the available stock of food grains in the country, but rather about the ability of the masses to purchase food grains during and after the pandemic.
If the current countrywide floods are prolonged for much longer, they could turn out to be a major threat for the production of food grains in the upcoming agriculture season in Bangladesh. It will have an adverse impact on poultry, dairy, fisheries and livestock production as well. During the lockdown period, farmers had to sell eggs and milk at lower than their production costs in order to survive, but this made them lose their sustainability. Most of the vegetable supply chains were also significantly disrupted and are under extreme stress.
According to a recent study conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the UN, farm gate prices in Bangladesh have dropped for eggs (-18 percent), broilers (-15 percent), day-old layer chicks (-75 percent) and day-old broiler chicks (-90 percent), with about 50 percent of eggs and 70 percent of broilers unsold at farms. Moreover, 40 to 50 percent of newly hatched day-old chicks were unsold and destroyed. About 50 percent of broiler farms are thought to be out of business already and are unlikely to risk starting a new crop. As a result, around 70,000 farmers will be affected. Layer farms will gradually shut down if low egg prices persist, and hatcheries and feed mills will face losses as well.
A survey by Khaddo Odhikar Bangladesh found that 87 percent of the poor (50 million) people of Bangladesh are already in a serious food crisis due to the coronavirus situation. Therefore, ensuring food security should be a priority for the government and relevant national and multilateral agencies, especially since overall market activity across the country has already been severely affected due to Covid-19 restrictions and current floods.
The government has already taken certain steps to deal with the challenges of agriculture production and food security in the coming days. The government stimulus package, which was announced at the start of the pandemic in Bangladesh, includes Tk 5,000 crore worth of soft loans with a six month grace period at four percent interest (reduced from 10 percent) to different agricultural sectors, including seasonal flower and fruit, fisheries, poultry, dairy and livestock. However, this excludes the crops and grains sectors.
Other support from the government includes the waiving of advance taxes on feed for fisheries, livestock and poultry and the easing of Letter of Credit (LC) margins for essential commodities. Instructions have also been issued on prioritised customs clearance and movement from ports of food, feed and allied products, and temporary port-side storage facilities have been created. No official restrictions were placed on the transport of food, feed and agricultural inputs and processing accessories across the country, even during the lockdown.
However, there are still a number of possible effects that the pandemic could have on the food supply chain during the upcoming agriculture season. There is a risk of shortage of labour due to travel restrictions and fear of infection, shortage of inputs like seeds, fertiliser, pesticide etc due to disrupted international trade, especially imports, and limited capacity of farmers to store harvested crops. We could also be potentially faced with factory or facility shutdowns, port restrictions and congestion, leading to the spoilage of perishables vegetables and fruits, and increasing food waste due to a a lack of refrigerated storage. Finally, there could also be delays of retrieval in capital investment.
All of these adverse effects may result in reduced incomes for the farmers, the destruction of supply chains due to panic buying, restricted access to food for low income groups and undernutrition of vulnerable groups. However, there are certain policies that can be followed to try and reduce these impacts and ensure food security. The government should immediately focus on increasing coverage of food distribution and supply and enhancing the benefits of country-wide social protection programmes. They should also collaborate with the international community to avert food shortages and price hikes by ensuring free trade and strengthening regional mechanisms for food security. It should be noted that the two to three million deaths in the Bengal famine of 1943 were due to food supply disruptions, not a lack of food availability, so it is crucial that the supply chains continue to function effectively.
Farmers and agricultural workers should also be included in the government's assistance packages and any social protection programmes that are addressing the crisis. The government's substantial agricultural stimulus package should start giving loans and grants on an urgent basis, and primary agriculture inputs like seed, fertilisers, pesticide etc should be made available at affordable costs.
In the long run, we should focus on accelerating the movement towards the mechanisation of agriculture, technology-based farming, value chain development and automation. During the pandemic and beyond, we should inspire direct marketing through online platforms to facilitate trading of produce, avoid food waste and mitigate loss of farmers' profits by reducing multiple layers of intermediaries. Cold chains should be established across districts as well to lengthen the shelf life of fresh vegetables, fruits and other produce. Additionally, the government should strengthen district-level food price volatility monitoring activities to control any unethical hikes of food prices.
It is heartening to see that the Bangladesh government has taken strong steps to protect the economy from the adverse effects of Covid-19, offering recovery packages worth more than a trillion Taka to different sectors. However, more attention is required for the agriculture sector in order to ensure food security for all in post-pandemic Bangladesh. Because of the prolonged floods on top of Covid-19, our farmers and low-income groups could become more susceptible to hunger in the near future.

Nevertheless, after much concerted effort from the most vulnerable developing countries, there was some success in getting the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) on loss and damage approved at COP19 in Poland in 2013. Under the WIM, an executive committee with a five year work programme was set up, which delivered some excellent technical products, including a task force report on displacement due to climate change (which falls under the WIM).
However, there has not been similar progress on the demand from vulnerable developing countries for innovative finance for loss and damage, beyond insurance. While insurance is definitely a potential way forward, it cannot be the only way to raise funds. Last year at the 25th Conference of Parties (COP25) held in Madrid, the vulnerable developing countries pushed hard for setting up a financial mechanism under the WIM to explore some new and innovative sources of funding loss and damage. This topic was one of the hot issues that took COP25 into two extra days of negotiations, and even then was not resolved to our satisfaction. All we got was to set up a technical arm of the WIM called the Santiago Network on Loss and Damage, but it had no financial arm, which we had demanded. Hence, COP25 was definitely a failed conference from the perspective of the vulnerable developing countries.
Preparations are now under way for COP26, which was originally supposed to have been hosted by the United Kingdom in November 2020, but has now been postponed to November 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This gives sufficient time for the UK as incoming chair of COP26 to consult widely with all relevant countries as well as civil society, and try to come up with a way forward to avoid the failure that was COP25.
How do we change the paradigm from mainly being a blame game to finding pragmatic solutions? A number of factors have made it very clear that climatic events are being significantly enhanced due to the increase of over one Degree Centigrade in the global atmospheric temperature as a result of human induced climate change, which means a discussion on loss and damage can no longer be postponed.
In 2020, the scientific community already made a major breakthrough by scientifically and credibly attributing the enhancement of the severity of different climatic events around the world. This includes super cyclone Amphan as well as the current floods, the present, severe fires in California and even the hurricanes Laura and Marco, which are currently in the Gulf of Mexico and likely to hit Texas.
This brings out the second new situation regarding the impacts that are attributable to human induced climate change and the associated loss and damage—namely that it is not just a matter for poor developing countries but for all countries, including the richest ones. Hence, it is now a global problem that will affect all countries, and every government will have to come up with solutions to protect their own populations.
The third additional factor is the global Covid-19 pandemic, which has clearly shown what the deadly consequences will be for national leaders who ignore the scientists and refuse to take timely actions. We are seeing, in real time, the enormous losses in human lives in countries where their leaders have ignored warnings from scientists and epidemiologists. Climate change scientists have been giving similar warnings, which unfortunately have been largely ignored so far, but now need to be taken more seriously if we wish to minimise the extent of global loss and damage going forward.
So the main paradigm shift that has occurred in 2020 is that the problem of addressing loss and damage is no longer a problem of the future, but rather a current and global problem that affects all countries. Hence, there is an urgent need to come up with solutions using a new paradigm of global solidarity, rather than that of a blame game.
The final aspect of the issue of loss and damage, which makes it more urgent than before, is the clear emerging attribution of displacement due to climate change, leading to the creation of climate change refugees—more popularly called climate migrants. This problem is now clearly attributable to human induced climate change and will become an even bigger political problem unless it is tackled early.
This is where the collaboration of the UK as the incoming chair of COP26 with Bangladesh—representing nearly 50 of the most vulnerable developing countries as chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF)—can be a useful vehicle to bring together developed and developing countries and find ways towards more pragmatic solutions in funding loss and damage beyond insurance.
At the same time, Bangladesh has the opportunity to offer a potential solution to set up its own national mechanism through implementation of the two year pilot project on loss and damage, which was announced by the government at COP24 in Katowice, Poland in 2019. This project needs to be fast tracked by the relevant ministries and taken forward as a two year public private partnership project to explore, in very practical ways, how Bangladesh can set up its own national mechanism on loss and damage.
This would also be another opportunity for Bangladesh to share it's experience in real time with other vulnerable countries in the CVF for South-South knowledge sharing on how to tackle this increasingly important hazard to our people and countries.
The negative impacts of human induced climate change are now visible every single day in different parts of the world. There is no longer any valid reason to drag our feet and delay the ways to find solutions for all countries in the spirit of mutual solidarity. This is an opportunity for the UK and Bangladesh to lead the world in finding acceptable solutions at COP26 next year. This opportunity should not be missed.

www.thedailystar.net/business/news/electronic-fiscal-devices-are-here-finally-1951089,Business,2020-08-26T00:00:00+06:00,2020-08-26T00:00:00+06:00,Electronic fiscal devices are here -- finally,"Electronic fiscal devices (EFDs), the much-talked-about e-cash registers promoted by the revenue authority as a tool to curb tax dodging, finally began to show up at retail stores in cities.

","Electronic fiscal devices (EFDs), the much-talked-about e-cash registers promoted by the revenue authority as a tool to curb tax dodging, finally began to show up at retail stores in cities.
The National Board of Revenue (NBR) yesterday launched the devices to monitor sales at 24 types of retail and wholesale stores to overcome the challenge of collecting the actual amount of value-added tax from tens of thousands of goods and services stores.
""The use of EFDs will bring about a revolutionary change in VAT collection,"" said NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem at the inauguration of the EFDs at the NBR headquarters in Dhaka.
Paid by consumers, VAT is the biggest source of revenue and NBR said the number of small and medium retail stores is too high for them to monitor due to a shortage of manpower.
Most of the taxpayers in the category are noncompliant and various complaints are raised from this trade against revenue collectors, NBR said.
Against the backdrop, the EFDs that will be connected to a central server to monitor real-time transaction and store sales data of retails will be instrumental in collecting the actual amount of VAT and curbing evasion, it said.
This will eliminate harassment, reduce the cost of business and increase revenue collection, Muneem said.
The revenue collector said it installed 100 e-sales registers -- 80 in Dhaka and the rest in the port city Chattogram -- on a pilot basis. Later, the pace of installation will increase to bring more stores under the automated system.
NBR aims to install the EFDs at the stores that register more than Tk 50 lakh in turnover annually.
Businesses ranging from hospitality and sweetmeat stores to clothing, furniture and electronics outlets will get the devices free of cost.
By September, 1,000 EFDs will be installed and a total of 100,000 by June next year, said Iqbal Hasan Ferdous, general manager of Synesis IT, a member of the consortium of Shenzhen-based SZZT-KMMT-Synesis-EATL JV that won the contract to supply the devices at Tk 316 crore to the NBR last fiscal year.
NBR had decided to set up the EFDs and sales data controllers three years ago after its previous bid to enforce the use of electronic cash registers failed mainly because of the absence of any electronic server to monitor transactions at shops.
There was no scope to capture real-time transactions and there was no tool for auto-monitoring, NBR said.
With the use of the EFDs, every transaction that would take place at the stores will be done through verification with the server at the revenue board.
The digital devices will also be helpful for businesses as they will be able to keep proper accounts of their sales and inventory of goods, NBR said.
""It will bring transparency. A buyer will clearly understand whether the VAT he or she has paid is deposited to the state coffer,"" Muneem said.
Buyers will be able to confirm the deposit of the tax by scanning the receipt. Besides, NBR will keep information of buyers in its server and hold lottery time to time to encourage consumers to ask for receipts of purchases.
NBR said it completed the preparations and had planned to inaugurate the e-devices on the occasion of the birth centenary of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
But it had to postpone the plan due to the outbreak of coronavirus and subsequent shutdown aimed at taming the deadly pathogen.
NBR decided to start installing the digital devices as the economy reopened and businesses restarted since the government-enforced lockdown was lifted by the end of May.
Revenue collection from retail trade will increase significantly because of the use of the electronic devices, Muneem said. ""The real benefit will come when the whole country will be under the EFD network,"" he added.
The consortium was asked to supply 10,000 EFDs initially."

An inter-session meeting of Bangladesh and USA in the Trade and Investment Cooperation Forum Agreement (TICFA) was held today where this demand was made. This is an inter-session meeting between the fifth and sixth rounds of TICFA meeting.
The fifth round was held in Dhaka in March this year.
""We need a lot of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for our country's development. US companies are the largest investors in Bangladesh mainly in power and energy sectors. We sought US investment in the pharmaceutical sector as this industry has been thriving in the country rapidly,"" said Commerce Secretary Md Jafar Uddin who led the Bangladesh side in the virtual meeting.
Christopher Wilson, assistant US Trade Representative (USTR) for South and Central Asia, led the US side in the meeting.
""Setting up vaccine manufacturing plants in Bangladesh by US investors might be a timely decision because the demand for vaccine is very high now,"" Jafar Uddin said after the meeting.
""We have also urged for US investment in non-covid pharmaceuticals industries,"" he said.
""We told the US to invest in contract manufacturing of medicine so that they can produce here and export from this country,"" the commerce secretary also said.
Investment in pharmaceuticals sector in Bangladesh could be lucrative to foreign investors as the country is eligible for manufacturing patent drugs cheaply until January 1, 2033 as per the decision of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) under the Trade – Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement.
Riding on the waiver of the compliance of the TRIPS agreement of WTO, the local pharmaceuticals industries thrived a lot and have been meeting 98 percent domestic demand. Many local pharmaceuticals industries have been exporting medicine to nearly 150 countries including USA, Canada, UK and the EU countries after meeting the local demand.
In the fiscal 2019-20, Bangladesh exported pharmaceuticals products worth $136 million, registering 4.49 percent year-on-year growth, according to data from Export Promotion Bureau (EPB).
Bangladesh also demanded relocation of US companies currently running in other countries, citing preferential trade privilege and competitive production costs in Bangladesh compared to other countries.
Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) in a virtual presentation also showed the country's strive in launching One Stop Service (OSS) centre to facilitate both local and international businesses.
The commerce secretary also said he raised the issue of reinstatement of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) for Bangladesh to the US market to enjoy zero-duty benefit on export of some locally produced goods like dry fish, tobacco and ceramics.
Before suspension of the GSP status, Bangladesh used to export products worth $24 million under the GSP facility.
The US government suspended GSP for Bangladesh in June 2013, citing poor labour rights and working conditions, after the nation's deadliest industrial accident -- Rana Plaza collapse -- in April 2013 that left some 1,138 workers dead and 2,500 workers severely injured.
After the suspension of the GSP, the then US government also gave 16 conditions to be fulfilled by the government and private sector of Bangladesh for the reinstatement of GSP status to the US markets.
Bangladesh has fulfilled the 16 conditions mainly relating to improving labour rights, workplace safety, inspection and remediation of the garment factory buildings by Accord and Alliance.
After fulfillment of the conditions, Bangladesh applied twice to the United States Trade Representative (USTR), America's principal trade negotiation body, for reviewing and reinstatement of the GSP status for Bangladesh.
However, the USTR is yet to reinstate Bangladesh's GSP status saying that a lot needs to be improved in the areas of labour rights.
""We are hopeful that the US will consider reinstatement of the GSP status to Bangladesh as we have already fulfilled US' conditions,"" said Jafar Uddin.
The commerce secretary further said Bangladesh also suggested duty-free export of locally made garment items, although US never gives zero duty benefit to any country for garment items, except some African countries under the African Growth and Opportunity Act on garment import.
Jafar Uddin asked the US delegation to allow zero duty benefit to Bangladesh if the apparels are made from the cotton imported from US. ""We can demand for duty-free facility on garment made from US cotton as we import a lot of American cotton in Bangladesh,"" he said.
The US delegation in the meeting demanded withdrawal of fumigation on import of US cotton as the import of, especially, the upland cotton has been increasing in Bangladesh recently.
The US cotton faces double fumigation in Bangladesh mainly to prevent the attack of bollworm in the cotton. The double fumigation on US cotton in the ports was introduced by the then Ayub Khan-led government of East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, on a complaint of attack by the insects and in an excuse of higher production of cotton.
TICFA was signed in November 2013 to create a platform for negotiating trade and investment between the two countries.
The US is Bangladesh's single largest export destination. As a least developed country, 97 percent of the goods originating from Bangladesh had enjoyed duty-free benefits in the US markets as per a decision taken during the Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade Organization in 2005.
However, the country's main export item, garments, was not included in the 97 percent package. Garment exports account for 95 percent of Bangladesh's exports to the US.
As a result, Bangladeshi exporters face 15.62 percent duty on the export of apparel items to the US markets.
In the fiscal 2019-20, Bangladesh exported goods worth $6.04 billion to the US market and imported goods worth $2.58 billion from US."

","A container ship that was listing to its starboard side while anchored at Chattogram port on Sunday returned to equilibrium the following day but is yet to be cleared for departure, making exporters anxious about their cargo.
The ship, OEL Hind, had listed due to an uneven distribution of cargo, said Muntasir Rubayat, head of operations for the vessel's local agent GBX Logistics.
Subsequently, the OEL Hind was brought back to a stable position by removing a total of 33 containers located at the top row.
But the Chattogram Port Authority (CPA) is yet to allow the vessel to leave, leaving the Bangladeshi exporters in a state of anxiety over whether their shipments on board the OEL Hind will reach their destinations on time.
The ship was scheduled to vacate jetty number 11 at the port on Sunday afternoon but was restricted from departure when it was found to be titled to its right that very morning.
The 186-metre-long vessel had a total of 1,260 TEUs of export-laden and empty containers on board at the time.
The cargo that could not be sent in time would now probably miss the connecting mother vessel at Singapore, said Khairul Alam Sujan, director of the Bangladesh Freight Forwarders Association.
Contacted, CPA Secretary Md Omar Faruk said that although the vessel seems to be in stable condition, the authorities need to ensure that the vessel is fit for operation.
To that end, the department of shipping is investigating with the help of ship surveyors to find if there are any technical faults with the vessel.
""As soon as they give the nod, the OEL Hind can set sail,"" he added."

Co-founded by Tesla Inc and SpaceX CEO Musk in 2016, San Francisco Bay Area-based Neuralink aims to implant wireless brain-computer interfaces that include thousands of electrodes in the most complex human organ to help cure neurological conditions like Alzheimer's, dementia and spinal cord injuries and ultimately fuse humankind with artificial intelligence.
""An implantable device can actually solve these problems,"" Musk said on a webcast Friday, mentioning ailments such as memory loss, hearing loss, depression and insomnia.
Musk did not provide a timeline for those treatments, appearing to retreat from earlier statements that human trials would begin by the end of this year. Neuralink's first clinical trials with a small number of human patients would be aimed at treating paralysis or paraplegia, the company's head surgeon Dr Matthew MacDougall said.
Neuroscientists unaffiliated with the company said the presentation indicated that Neuralink had made great strides but cautioned that longer studies were needed.
Musk presented what he described as the ""three little pigs demo."" Gertrude, the pig with a Neuralink implant in the part of its brain that controls the snout, required some coaxing by Musk to appear on camera, but eventually began eating off of a stool and sniffing straw, triggering spikes on a graph tracking the animal's neural activity.
Musk said the company had three pigs with two implants each and also revealed a pig that previously had an implant. They were ""healthy, happy and indistinguishable from a normal pig,"" Musk said. Musk said the company predicted a pig's limb movement during a treadmill run at ""high accuracy"" using implant data.
Musk described Neuralink's chip, which is roughly 23 millimetres (0.9 inches) in diameter, as ""a Fitbit in your skull with tiny wires.""
""I could have a Neuralink right now and you wouldn't know,"" Musk said. ""... Maybe I do.""
One comment from a webcast viewer described the animals as ""Cypork.""
Graeme Moffat, a University of Toronto neuroscience research fellow, said Neuralink's advancements were ""order of magnitude leaps"" beyond current science thanks to the novel chip's size, portability, power management and wireless capabilities.
Stanford University neuroscientist Sergey Stavisky said the company had made substantial and impressive progress since an initial demonstration of an earlier chip in July 2019.
""Going from that to the fully implanted system in several pigs they showed is impressive and, I think, really highlights the strengths of having a large multidisciplinary team focused on this problem,"" Stavisky said.
Some researchers said longer studies would be required to determine the longevity of the device.
Neuralink's chip could also improve the understanding of neurological diseases by reading brain waves, one of the company's scientists said during the presentation.
Musk said the focus of Friday's event was recruiting, not fundraising. Musk has a history of bringing together diverse experts to drastically accelerate the development of innovations previously limited to academic labs, including rocket, hyperloop and electrical vehicle technologies through companies such as Tesla and SpaceX.
Neuralink has received $158 million in funding, $100 million of which came from Musk, and employs about 100 people.
Musk, who frequently warns about the risks of artificial intelligence, said the implant's most important achievement beyond medical applications would be ""some kind of AI symbiosis where you have an AI extension of yourself.""
Small devices that electronically stimulate nerves and brain areas to treat hearing loss and Parkinson's disease have been implanted in humans for decades. Brain implant trials have also been conducted with a small number of people who have lost control of bodily functions due to spinal cord injuries or neurological conditions like strokes.
Startups such as Kernel, Paradromics and NeuroPace also are trying to exploit advancements in material, wireless and signalling technology to create devices similar to Neuralink. In addition, medical device giant Medtronic PLC produces brain implants to treat Parkinson's disease, essential tremors and epilepsy."
www.thedailystar.net/opinion/straight-line/news/policing-the-police-1952973,"Opinion, STRAIGHT LINE",2020-08-30T00:00:00+06:00,2020-08-30T00:00:00+06:00,Policing the police,"Following the death of Major Sinha in circumstances indicative of collusive criminal behaviour of some apparently errant police personnel along with other delinquencies of lawmen elsewhere in the country, well-meaning citizens have expressed their apprehensions about control and accountability of our police or the lack of it.

","Following the death of Major Sinha in circumstances indicative of collusive criminal behaviour of some apparently errant police personnel along with other delinquencies of lawmen elsewhere in the country, well-meaning citizens have expressed their apprehensions about control and accountability of our police or the lack of it. Academics refer to an expression called ""Quis Custodist Custodes"", meaning who will police the police?  
In a modern democracy, under the separation of powers system, all three branches of the government can exercise a form of constraint over the police. The executive exercises financial control and appoints key functionaries. The legislature can define powers and restrictions on those powers and include in Police Acts or other statutes discipline codes and regulations. The judiciary, too, can exercise some control over police by setting precedent which establishes acceptable police practice.
It would appear that police are constrained rather than controlled by the legislature, judiciary and executive, and within those parameters police retain the right to carry out their task as they choose. At the extremes, the independence of police from any control and absolute government control of police are both undesirable.
The media also has considerable power to hold both individuals and groups accountable, and police are no exception. Painstaking investigative journalism can shine a light into dark, corrupt corners and keep it there until something is done about it. The media has an important role in maintaining the style of policing acceptable to the public. Public perceptions are largely determined by the media.
The courts have significant power to affect police behaviour. It may monitor police behaviour and use power to exclude evidence in order to impose sanctions on police behaviour. If courts do not accept particular practices as a fair means of obtaining evidence, then police will be forced to obtain evidence by using means which are acceptable to the court. 
The death of Major Sinha has been described as an isolated incident. However, it has to be noted that for delinquency to thrive in an organisation, it is not necessary for all to be deviant, or even the majority; all that is needed is for there to be a sufficient number of individuals in key positions so that they can keep the rest in line, order the honest away, and divert those in higher authority from the fact. Diverting the authority is made easier if the fact is something that those in authority have no wish to hear. It also needs to be impressed that any government not involved in police deviance but strongly supportive of its police should strive to reduce allegations of police malpractice.
There is no clear defining point at which the malpractices that have come to notice can no longer be considered to be isolated incidents or the deviance of ""a few rotten apples in the barrel"", but has escalated to be indicative of a general malaise within the police organisation. In Australia, Britain and America, police organisations have all been subject to external investigation by public commissions which normally publish a report at the conclusion of the taking of evidence or submission.
An essential safeguard within policing a democratic society, which gives the public confidence in its police, is the existence of a fair and effective procedure for complaining about individual instances of alleged police misconduct, and having those complaints properly investigated and resolved. As with much of crime and policing, the public perception that the system is fair and efficient is as important as the objective fairness of the system. Investigation of complaints must not only be carried out fully and fairly but also be done and seen to be done.
Individuals in Bangladesh have a right to expect that if police behaviour toward them is sufficiently bad, avenues exist whereby complaints can be made and possibly disciplinary proceedings follow against the offending officers. Public confidence in a complaints investigation system comes from the knowledge that any complaint will be rigorously investigated. This perception is an even more important issue since there is a very real public fear that complaints against police will not be taken seriously and that serious matter will be covered up by an internal investigation.
In Bangladesh public confidence will increase when the police complaints system will provide for an external body to supervise an investigation, or to review the evidence and conclusions drawn by police investigations, especially when this body shall have the power and the will to carry out an impartial review and order a re-investigation if necessary. In Australia and Britain, statutory bodies have been established to oversee internal investigations of complaints against police. In those countries there exist a review board with non-police community representatives to make decisions on the disposition of the complaints.
The society as a whole is deeply concerned with the standard of behaviour such as police integrity, the manner in which incidents are generally handled including the amount of force it finds acceptable and unacceptable in carrying out police duties and the interpersonal skills used by police in their dealings with the public. It has a right to have its voice heard, and the requirements of society with the regard to policing method and standard must be satisfied.
The mechanism of last resort for a police organisation to be held accountable to the general public is by means of some form of judicial inquiry or commission into policing. In instances of improper and illegal detention, the Apex Court have the jurisdiction to compensate the victim by awarding suitable monetary compensation.
Any system of police accountability will ultimately require legislative force. Whatever system of external supervision of police complaint is used, all systems need legislation to establish both police and public powers and duties, rights and obligations with regard to complaints investigation. If police are to be accountable to the public by a system of consultative committees, these will work best if they are established according to parameters led down by legislation.

www.thedailystar.net/opinion/black-white-and-grey/news/will-the-state-take-responsibility-1952965,"Opinion, Black, White and Grey",2020-08-30T00:00:00+06:00,2020-08-30T00:00:00+06:00,‘Will the state take responsibility?’,“Who will accept responsibility for the incident? Will the state take responsibility?” Asked the Supreme Court of Bangladesh on February 13 of this year to the lawyers representing the state of Bangladesh while addressing a review petition. The review petition was submitted by the state. These questions were about those who have disappeared and remained missing for years.  ,"""Who will accept responsibility for the incident? Will the state take responsibility?"" Asked the Supreme Court of Bangladesh on February 13 of this year to the lawyers representing the state of Bangladesh while addressing a review petition. The review petition was submitted by the state. These questions were about those who have disappeared and remained missing for years.  
The review petition was not about the growing incidence of enforced disappearances, but about the provisions for arrest without a warrant. But the exasperation of the highest court of the land about enforced disappearance was quite evident. While expressing dissatisfaction over the non-implementation of a 16-year-old High Court (HC) order regarding Section 54 of the CrPC, which allows arrest without a warrant and interrogation on remand, the court asked these two questions—plain and simple, about a more disturbing phenomenon. The Attorney General did not respond to these queries, as it was not germane to the case at hand, or simply because it appeared to him as rhetorical. 
That enforced disappearances have become routine in Bangladesh in the past decade is an understatement. According to the human rights group, Odhikar, a total of 553 persons have become victims between 2009 and 2019, and in the past six months, 14 individuals faced the same predicament. The stories of these incidents are familiar and almost similar. Family members and friends have alleged that these individuals have been picked up, either from their home or from the streets, by plain-clothed members of law enforcing agencies such as the RAB, or the police. The law enforcement agencies deny that the person was brought to their custody. When the family members visit the local police station or the RAB camps, the answer is ""he is not here"".
Often the police refuse to register a case, particularly when the complaint is against any of the law enforcing agencies alleging them as the perpetrators. There are instances when family members have knocked on all the doors one can think of—filing written complaints to the police, the RAB, other government bodies including military intelligence and the National Human Rights Commission. Yet, nobody has an answer—where is the person?
In some instances, those who ""disappeared"", mysteriously return. According to Ain O Salish Kendra (ASK), between 2014 and August 2018, of the 310 abductees, 33 persons returned. But many others do not. Their families keep on hoping—their day will come, and their loved ones will be coming home—one day. They pray and whenever opportunities arrive—they plead to the authorities, to the prime minister. For them, God and the government are the places where they can ask, and they do. Often, children, parents or spouses of the victims are offered sympathy from the higher ups; promises are made that all will be done to find their loved ones. But seldom are their prayers answered, and far less the government takes the trouble to tell the families what is being done, let alone bring the victims home.
In some instances, families are told that their loved ones were found dead. For example, in 2019, of the 34 who were reported to be picked up by law enforcing agencies, eight were found dead; 17 were released or produced before the courts. The instances of producing before the court is relieving for the families, the victims are alive and no longer traceless, but what is inexplicable is how did these people, who for days or weeks were not there, suddenly appear.
Not only these incidents, but the entire phenomenon of enforced disappearances have been denied by the government, time and again. Appearing before the United Nations Committee against Torture in June 2019, for the first time since ratifying the Convention 20 years ago, Bangladesh's representatives, including the Law Minister, emphatically denied any incidents of enforced disappearances. Anisul Huq said, ""We do not agree to the proposition that enforced disappearances occur in Bangladesh frequently."" Alas! if it was only true for those who are still waiting for their loved ones, when every knock on the door raised their hopes—he is back.
While the government continue to deny, international human rights organisations, who have investigated cases of such incidents have concluded to the contrary. In a report published in April 2019, the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) alleged that these are neither sporadic nor arbitrary incidents, but ""part of a concerted strategy executed by State actors."" Describing these as ""systematic"" and ""amount to a State policy"", the FIDH insisted that as ""most of the victims were targeted on political grounds... these acts [qualify] as a crime against humanity."" 
The allegation of ""crime against humanity"" is derived from the internationally accepted agreement called, ""International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance"".  In Article 2 of the Convention, enforced disappearance is defined as ""the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorisation, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law"". The Convention further stipulates in Article 5, ""The widespread or systematic practice of enforced disappearance constitutes a crime against humanity as defined in applicable international law and shall attract the consequences provided for under such applicable international law.""
In the court or outside, the AG has not responded to the question the Supreme Court asked, but the Law Minister's denial is an answer to the question. If the government is confident that no such incidents take place, it is incumbent on the government to take steps to show that it has done its part, stipulated in Article 12 of the Convention: ""Each State Party shall ensure that any individual who alleges that a person has been subjected to enforced disappearance has the right to report the facts to the competent authorities, which shall examine the allegation promptly and impartially and, where necessary, undertake without delay a thorough and impartial investigation"" (Article 12). Although Bangladesh is not a signatory to the Convention, it does not preclude it to act along the stipulated line.
The continued denial of the government of enforced disappearances is disturbing, but unfortunately not surprising because increasingly the incumbent has created a system of governance which is devoid of any accountability. In the past decade, as the country witnessed its journey further away from any semblance of democracy, the incumbent has become more reliant on coercion, and the coercive apparatuses of the state have become predominant in governance. With two consecutive elections which can be hardly described as ""elections"", the entire accountability mechanism of governance has fallen by the wayside. With the demise of the vertical accountability mechanism, that is holding free and fair elections, the need for horizontal accountability mechanisms, that is holding the government accountable by the non-state institutions, became imperative. But the abject failure of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to raise its voice against incidents of enforced disappearances, let alone act robustly, show how deep the crisis has become.
As we raise voices against enforced disappearance, we should underscore that the question of enforced disappearances is intrinsically connected to the system of governance and accountability, and unequivocally say that the state must take responsibility.

Some were later released, while others remained indefinitely “disappeared” (or “goom”) in what are known as enforced disappearance cases.  ","The law has repeatedly been side-lined in recent years by law enforcers, who have illegally abducted or ""picked up"" people and detained them secretly in custody, without following due legal process. Some were later released, while others remained indefinitely ""disappeared"" (or ""goom"") in what are known as enforced disappearance cases.  
Over the last two years, a new dimension  has emerged in such enforced disappearance cases—where cases are filed against people subsequent to their detention under laws such as the Digital Security Act—which journalists, human rights activists, and people from many sectors alike have expressed concerns about, for its curbing effect on freedom of expression.
This act is now newly connected with the culture of ""goom"", as law enforcement agencies are taking it upon themselves to silence people who are expressing views that are seen as ""anti-government"" or anti-state agencies, and prevent these views from entering into the public discourse by abducting them illegally. In this way, law enforcement agencies are dangerously side-lining the judicial system and acting as both judge and jury as well as violating citizen's fundamental rights as guaranteed in the constitution and under domestic law.
The phrase ""picked up"" indicates illegality i.e. abduction. Police and law enforcement agencies cannot ""pick up"" people—they can only arrest. Arrest and abduction are two different things. Abduction is taking someone away from lawful custody i.e. their home, whereas a person is arrested when they commit an offence under the law—the two have different consequences.
But the language we hear is that someone was picked up at night by peopleinplainclothes in a car without number plates. For example, in April this year, Didarul Alam Bhuiyan was ""picked up"" for his allegedly ""anti-government"" comments on Facebook. When he was picked up, the law enforcers were not wearing uniforms though at the time of the Supreme Court judgment regarding Section 54 of the CrPC, it was clearly laid down that those without uniform/outside their working hours cannot arrest anyone. When this arrest was taking place, law enforcers were still on duty—just working the night shift. Day or night, why aren't they wearing their uniforms if they're working? Without uniforms and identification, law enforcement agencies have no authority to enter into private premises. They need a warrant from the court that they can enter into a house to arrest a particular person.
When Didarul was ""picked up"", there was no case against him under the DSA or any other act. Therefore, there was no legal justification for arresting him or entering his premises. It was a violation of Didarul's rights and that of his family's, safeguarded in the constitution, to liberty and safety.
It is also a violation under sections 54 and 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898. Section 54 of the CrPC lays down when the police can arrest someone based on suspicion. This section was modified by the HC division and subsequently upheld by the appellate division in 2015 (judgement formally came on April 24, 2016). Section 167 of the CrPC is about police taking people to remand. This was also modified by the HC which gave the 15-point directives. The court's observation regarding sections 54 and 167 was that the fundamental rights guaranteed in the constitution would be violated based on certain provisionsand thus needed to be modified and separate directives given.
Section 54 is important, because when there is no criminal case against Didarul, on what basis can the police go to his house, arrest him, or even question him? They could only do so if they follow the SC directives on it. Under the original law, if a police officer suspects or there is any reason to believe a person has committed an offense or will commit one, then the officer can arrest that person without a warrant and without an order from a magistrate.
The SC modified this so this ""suspicion"" has to be reasonable and it has to be noted by the officer in a diary as to why he suspects someone and their activities and what he or she has witnessed of the suspect's activities. When a person is arrested, they are also supposed to be produced before the court within 24 hours, he or she should be notified that they can make a call to their family and to a lawyer. If they have no mobile on them, the police have to provide means of communication for them.
In case of such ""disappearances"", the opposite has happened. When Didar's family was looking for him at thanas and RAB offices, they were told he had not been brought in anywhere.
That's the point at which these cases become ""goom"": when you're not following any judicial process, you are denying that you arrested him, you did not arrest him on a specific case's warrant, and after bringing him in say you do not have him under your custody. There was no account of his whereabouts for two days, and after these two days, cases against him (and 11 others) were filed under the DSA.
As the case was filed two days after his disappearance, the whole process is illegal. That is an enforced disappearance.
Earlier this year, this happened with journalist Shafiqul Islam Kajol. The case against him was filed on March 9 this year by Saifuzzaman Shikhor. On March 10, he ""disappeared"" in the evening. He was found after 53 days in the border town of Benapole and the story circulated was that he was trying to enter back into the country without a valid passport.
In the meantime, his wife filed a case with the Chawkbazar police station saying that her husband had gone missing/was abducted since March 10. There is no progress in that case, the police did not say a word regarding the outcome of the investigation of that case. Basically, they did not carry out any investigation. Where was he? The responsibility lies with the state to tell us where he was these 53 days. If the state says he crossed the border without a passport and he was hiding in India, in that case they need to prove it. They need to give us an explanation of what happened during those 53 days—because there is a case pending at Chawkbazar police station.
He was abducted before he was shown formally arrested in a particular case. There is now subsequently a case under the Passport Order, 1973 at the Benapole port police station and three cases filed under the DSA against him—one in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar police station, another in Hazaribagh police station, and the third in Kamrangirchar police station.
But look at the process. The cases were there [since March] but there was no investigation, no application showing him for arrest after the cases were filed, and then after 53 days, he was shown formally arrested. In the Sher-e-Bangla case, he was shown arrested on June 23 but he was arrested from the border on May 3.
Look at the time and look at the gap. First, they are grabbing people, holding them in their custody without any explanation and without following any judicial or legal procedure at all. Then, they are planting a case against that particular person and forwarding him before the learned magistrate for further judicial procedure.
The judicial system is crippled and thus we are failing to make law enforcement agencies accountable and answer for such actions.
Another dimension, indirectly related to enforced disappearances, emerged during photojournalist Shahidul Alam's case last year.
When someone is accused, no matter by a state agency or any individual, they are accused not guilty. Until proven guilty in a trial, convicted by a competent court, the law needs to treat the person as innocent.
""Innocent until proven guilty"" is not just a rhetoric but a guiding principle in criminal proceedings. While innocent and even after found guilty of a particular crime following a trial, the person's fundamental rights cannot be waived.
If a person under police custody is beaten or tortured, under the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act, 2013, action needs to be taken against the police. In this particular torture case, the person is a victim, despite being accused in another case. When the law enforcement agency hits or physically assaults a person or commits some type of physical or mental torture, then that person becomes a victim.
The accused in enforced disappearance cases are getting no such protection and we have not been able to get any legal forum to effectively address these questions and ensure their fundamental rights are safeguarded.
The Constitution is the supreme law of the country. Law enforcers are supposed to follow it.
When someone is being ""picked up"" or ""goom""—for a complaint for which there could be various elements, as is seen, personal/political vested interests—the violations of the legal system is dangerous to every citizen's safety. That means, this legal protection and fundamental rights exist only on paper.

In his tracks, PK Halder left four non-banking financial institutions (NBFI) in ruin, and in case you were wondering why he chose four NBFIs instead of banks, the answer could be because many of our banks' vaults may very well be empty already. 
After all, as this newspaper reported on August 16, financial regulators and government organisations are still struggling to recover Tk 18,253 crore that were embezzled in five of the more spectacular financial scams involving the country's banks. Even that aside, the financial sector is reeling from huge defaulted loans.
As the report also mentioned, the prime suspects in some of those cases were not even the main accused in the lawsuits due to them being connected with influential quarters. So can you really blame PK Halder? If all those crooks got their share, I bet Halder must have thought, ""why not me""? ""I'm a crook too."" This is what happens when you sit idly by while delinquents rob the public exchequer.
On January 8 this year, the Anti-Corruption Commission filed a case against Halder for amassing property worth around Tk 274.91 crore from unknown sources. Upon digging deeper—a bit too little too late, mind you—the Anti-Corruption Commission unearthed that Halder's shell companies had borrowed massive sums of money from the NBFIs without collateral, ""perhaps"" because he owned shares in those NBFIs.
This, too, is an old story. It was similar corruption that had previously led to another NBFI—First Finance—being unable to maintain its mandatory cash reserve with the central bank. As well as the corruption that nearly sank the Farmers Bank (""Banking Sector: A house of cards"", The Daily Star, December 27, 2017). Yet, our banks, NBFIs, and the regulators seem not to have learned any lessons, which gives the impression that either they are extremely slow learners (very unlikely) or simply don't want to learn (more likely).
Nevertheless, one mustn't take any credit away from Halder for being a dedicated and expert criminal. He took years to amass his wealth through one fraud after another. He bided his time, and took the opportunity of having people like one of his cousins, and a former college being in key positions of the institutions he robbed, to rob them.
Halder could not have committed the crimes all on his own, neither could he have perpetrated them with just one or two accomplices. Clearly others were involved in them—we are talking about Tk 274.91 crore after all. In this connection, the ACC has summoned multiple people for questioning. Let's hope that this time they catch the perpetrators before they launder all the money and themselves, out of the country.
Undoubtedly there is something wrong in our system which is letting such huge amounts of money to be siphoned out of the country. For example, it was the ACC's blunder which allowed Motazzaroul Islam Mithu, who has several medical equipment supplying companies including Lexicon Merchandize and Meditech Imaging Ltd, to take over control of tenders in the health sector. In 2013, serious anomalies in the health sector led the ACC to ask Mithu to submit a wealth statement following the allegation that he had amassed wealth of about Tk 50 crore beyond the known source of income. But he did not bother to respond to the notice.
Later on, his syndicate looted about Tk 450 crore without supplying any medical equipment to the Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, according to a letter issued to the public administration ministry on May 30. According to a US-based real estate information providing online service, in 2014 Mithu bought a villa in New York spending Tk 6.6 crore (USD 847,500). Had the ACC been more proactive, it is possible that Mithu could have been exposed long ago. However, given the ACC's lethargy, Mithu managed to continue amassing wealth and in 2016, his name surfaced in the Panama and Paradise Papers leaks—and it is quite likely that he has laundered huge sums of money out of the country.
A Global Financial Integrity report ranks Bangladesh as one of the top countries facing trade-based money laundering (TBML), which is a significant threat to growth and sustainable development. It estimates that some USD 3.1 billion, or Tk 26,400 crore, is being illegally remitted from Bangladesh a year. To address this, the government is expected to tighten tax rules soon—and taxpayers who inflate values of goods when declaring investments in their tax returns will have to face a hefty fine. But will that be enough? What about those who are defrauding banks and NBFIs—and particularly those with ""political connections""—and laundering the money they have hollowed out of them?
The problem is not only a shortage of regulation, but a lack of their proper application, equally for all. As Tacitus, the famous Roman historian and politician said, ""the more corrupt the state, the more numerous the laws"". And Bangladesh seems to have become a prime example of what he was referring to.
As long as the authorities turn a blind eye to ""some"" because of their ""political connection"", many more who are perhaps not as well connected—and therefore have to flee to some foreign country after robbing banks, NBFIs or other institutions, instead of taking over banks or public offices in the country—will continue to follow in their footsteps. In the meanwhile, huge sums of taxpayers' money will continue to get drained from the economy, causing enormous damage to Bangladesh.
Moreover, it is not only the perpetrators of these crimes that must be held accountable, but the regulators who ""fail to notice them on time"" and either stop them or apprehend the criminals, who must also be punished. Along with those ""connected"" individuals who try to influence the regulators—as it is mainly this practice that has made our regulatory bodies toothless.

The 17-time Grand Slam winner fended off Raonic's mighty serve to extend his 2020 winning run to 23-0, clinching his 80th career title and equalling Rafael Nadal's record of 35 Masters 1000 wins.
Battling through a neck injury, Djokovic struggled early in the match as he produced four double faults in the first set. Raonic took advantage of the world number one's misfiring serve to close out the set in just 30 minutes.
""Was a bit slow at the beginning, but I thought I did well, considering the form that Milos is in,"" the 33-year-old Serbian told reporters.
""He's serving rockets on the court, and it's really hard to return. You need all the freshness mentally and all the focus that you can possibly have.""
Djokovic, who had beaten the 29-year-old Canadian in all 10 of their previous match-ups, came roaring back, unleashing his powerful forehand and winning four straight games in the final set.
The tournament, a final tune-up ahead of the U.S. Open, which begins on Monday, was staged in front of empty stands at Flushing Meadows instead of its usual venue in Mason near Cincinnati, Ohio. The tournament formed part of a secure bubble that was created due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Djokovic faces Bosnia's Damir Dzumhur on Arthur Ashe Stadium on Monday in the first round of the Grand Slam, which is being staged without any fans in attendance this year due to the coronavirus outbreak.
""There is a certain tension,"" said Djokovic, who was heavily criticised earlier this year after he and three other players contracted COVID-19 during an exhibition event he had organised in the Balkan region.
""Everyone is obviously being careful, but at the same time everyone needs to pay attention and follow the protocols and restrictions that are in place."""

","The findings of the Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies (BILS) on job losses and shuttering of garment factories for the coronavirus pandemic have been trashed by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) and the Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments (DIFE).
At a press conference in National Press Club on Thursday, BILS said the layoffs and shuttering involved some 1,915 garment factories while some 324,684 workers lost their jobs between April and July.
Moreover, some 60 per cent of the workers were apprehending losing their jobs as a fallout of the coronavirus, the report stated.
The BILS higher-ups said the study was carried out with information provided by DIFE, BGMEA and the Industrial Police.
However, both DIFE and BGMEA said the number of layoffs and shuttering was not as high as was presented in the study.
In a press statement yesterday, BGMEA categorically disagreed with the findings.
""It would not be an exaggeration if the study report is termed as the default of morality,"" the statement read.
Some 300 small and medium factories, most of which work on subcontracts, had shut down during the study period, said Rezwan Selim, a director of BGMEA who handles labour issues and factory shutdowns.
These small BGMEA-member factories could not avail government soft loans at 2 per cent service charge as they could not fulfil a lot of the terms and conditions, he said.
About 48,000 workers have lost their jobs in and around Dhaka and they are from the subcontracting factories that were not receiving work orders from their mother factories.
""The BILS figures are too high and misleading,"" he said, adding that the factories, by and large, are running at 70 per cent capacity now as the buyers are coming back.
He went on to cite recent export figures to further his point about the inaccuracy of the BILS figures.
Between 1 and 22 August, garment export from Bangladesh increased 45.8 per cent year-on-year to $2.4 billion.
""If the job terminations and shuttering of factories had been as high as BILS mentioned, the export figures would not have risen by such a margin,"" he added.
The study's findings were inconsistent with what was in reality, said Shibnath Roy, inspector general of DIFE.
About 26,000 workers were terminated during this pandemic, according to DIFE.
A few factories did shut down and some workers had been laid off at the beginning of April but the figures are not as high as BILS stated, he said.
Moreover, some small and medium factories either shut down or went for layoffs for a brief period in April and May, he said.
Though the government instructed a general shutdown from 26 March, it was not applicable on factories with production ongoing based on work orders at hand.
Officially, DIFE never instructed the factory owners to shut down or go for layoffs during the pandemic, Roy said.
""The situation in the garment sector is quite peaceful now because the number of incidents of labour unrest is very few, almost zero.""
The international retailers are coming back and the factories are running quite well.
In fact, this month DIFE did not receive any complaint from any worker or union about terminations or factory shutdowns, Roy added.
Some 26 member factories reported shutting down while no factory reported layoffs, said Mohammad Hatem, vice-president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association.
""The BILS data is too high,"" he added.
Amirul Haque Amin, the vice-chairman of BILS, admitted that the study had a lot of limitations.
The report's findings are at least two months old.
""By this time, the situation in the garment sector improved a lot as there was almost no labour unrest for payment and termination. We should have updated the number of job losses and factory shutdowns,"" Amin told The Daily Star over the phone.
Moreover, international retailers are now coming back with a lot of work orders while many are reissuing cancelled work orders to the local suppliers.
""The report should have contained the latest updates so that no confusion was created among the people,"" he said, adding that many of the sector's positive facts have not been reflected.
That the study had limitations and should have incorporated the latest updates were agreed upon by the BILS Director Nazma Yesmin.
She assured providing the latest information to the media soon to avert any confusion."

Now, it sells an array of face masks in different categories -- essential, fashion, embroidery, technical and denim—for men, women and children -- at its 15 stores.

Its printed double layer mask is made with cotton fabric and its innovative shape means it can be used as a mask and also as a scarf.
The brand has brought out embroidered woven fashion mask hena exclusively to cater to women. Made of cotton fabric for a firm and comfortable fit, the mask has a soft inner layer (non-dyed) next to the skin to avoid irritation and it is washable.
""Our masks are for non-medical use. Most of them can be washable and reusable.""
So far, Yellow, which will soon manufacture four-layer N95 mask and a three-layer surgical mask, has sold 2.5 lakh units of face masks, according to Chowdhury.
It has been a week that another retail clothing behemoth Aarong started selling masks from a third-party supplier.
""The response is tremendous. More than 50 per cent of the masks were sold in seven days,"" said Mohammad Ashraful Alam, chief executive officer of Aarong.
To cater to the demand, Aarong will launch a face mask production line in a factory of Ayesha Abed Foundation, which serves as one of the top supply hubs of the brand, from next week.
""Our mask will be fashionable so that they match our clothing items,"" he said, adding that masks will be made following the guidelines of the World Health Organisation and the Directorate General of Health Services.
The brand is bringing out six types of face masks and for men, women and children.
Sara, a lifestyle brand of apparel exporter Snowtex, began selling masks from the middle of April.
""We are overwhelmed with the customer's response and once we bring out the product it gets sold out very quickly,"" said SM Khaled, managing director of Snowtex and Sara.
So far, it has sold about 2 lakh units.
The brand, which has five stores in the capital, invested heavily on research so that the quality of face masks improves.
""Now our masks provide 72 per cent protection level against airborne viruses. It will soon cross 90 per cent.""
Ensuring both breathability and protection at the same time is the main challenge in manufacturing face masks, according to Khaled.
Sara makes embroidered and printed masks for fashionable persons. The brand's masks for non-medical use are priced at Tk 40-50 and the ornate ones at about Tk 200.
Sultana Nasreen Shumi, the owner of upscale boutique Azaaraz in Gulshan, has started giving a complementary mask to customers with every dress ordered.
""I do not sell masks at shops. But I am giving out a mask with each of my products out of responsibility,"" she said.
Azaaraz makes face masks matching its outfits.
""If an outfit is red, I make a red mask. And if the dress is embroidered, I embroider the mask too.""
She said a lot of the people have come out of their homes following the easing of restrictions but they are not wearing masks because they do not have beautiful ones.
This prompted her to figure out how to create fashionable masks such that people wear it.
Although Azaaraz does not sell masks directly, she selectively accepts some orders from clients.
""Even I got some orders for masks for brides and grooms,"" Shumi said, emphasising safety in addition to gorgeousness and fashion."

Like many other retail chain owners, Kishore Biyani-promoted Future Group's business has been affected by a slowing economy and the coronavirus pandemic.
""Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL), subsidiary of Reliance Industries, will acquire the retail and wholesale business and the logistics and warehousing business from the Future Group for a lumpsum aggregate consideration of INR 24,713 crore,"" the Reliance Industries said in a statement on Saturday night.
Through the deal, Reliance will acquire Future Retail that owns the Big Bazaar that sells a wide range of goods from groceries to cosmetics and apparel and Future Lifestyle Fashions Ltd that operates fashion discount chain Brand Factory.
The Reliance-Future deal is set to escalate the war in India's retail sector. Amazon has already pledged to invest USD 5.5 billion in the country, while Walmart bought local e-commerce giant Flipkart in 2018 for USD 16 billion.
Even though Reliance will take over Future Consumer Ltd, which sells food, home and personal care products, Future Group's financial and insurance business is not part of the deal.
While Reliance Industries has bought out all of the promoter stake in Future Retail and Future Lifestyle Fashions - the two firms that hold the Future Group business, it was not immediately clear what happens to Amazon's holding in the Future.
In August last year, Seattle-based Amazon took an indirect stake of 1.3 per cent in Future Retail as a result of purchasing 49 per cent of Future Coupons Ltd. This investment allows it to buy into Future Retail after a period of between 3 and 10 years.
Retail contributes about a fourth of RIL's revenues.
Investment from Reliance, India''s most valuable company, would help Future's founder Kishore Biyani pare debt. The deal may, however, risk Future's tie-up with the US online shopping giant Amazon."
www.thedailystar.net/business/news/bangladesh-still-among-top-sourcing-destinations-1953273,Business,2020-08-30T00:00:00+06:00,2020-08-30T00:00:00+06:00,Bangladesh still among top sourcing destinations,"Bangladesh remains one of the top sourcing destinations after China for international clothing retailers and brands even during the coronavirus pandemic because of its competitive prices, according to a new report by leading supply chain compliance solutions provider QIMA.

","Bangladesh remains one of the top sourcing destinations after China for international clothing retailers and brands even during the coronavirus pandemic because of its competitive prices, according to a new report by leading supply chain compliance solutions provider QIMA.
After Vietnam, India and Bangladesh, alternative sourcing options of choice are still largely countries in Asia, including Taiwan, which enjoyed overwhelming preference as a sourcing market among US-based respondents.
The survey named ""Evolution of Sourcing in 2020"" was conducted in July 2020 by Hong Kong-based QIMA.
It is said to be drawn on input from more than 200 businesses around the world across a variety of consumer product segments and built on previous QIMA research.
The report analyses the evolution of global sourcing in response to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, US-China trade tensions and other disruptions to global supply chains.
It says China is down, but not out.
Although China still takes the crown for global sourcing, its dominance is noticeably less dramatic compared to previous years, especially in industries such as textile and apparel, where supplier portfolio diversification has been a priority for a while now, the QIMA report said.
Nevertheless, 75 per cent of the respondents globally named China among their top three sourcing geographies, with 55 per cent reporting that Chinese suppliers accounted for over half the buying volumes in the first half of the year.
Vietnam continues with its upward trend, luring in Western buyers as an alternative to China.
Consistently ranking among China's regional competitors, Vietnam continues to reap the most benefits of the continued mass exodus of Western buyers from China, with 40 per cent of the EU respondents and almost as many US brands included Vietnam among their top sourcing regions.
This is in tune with Western brands not venturing too far from China.
The US and the EU brands are exploring sourcing options closer to home but are more likely to near-shore rather than re-shore.
For US-based companies, sourcing destinations closer to their home country continue to grow steadily, with the popularity of Latin and South America almost doubling compared with last year.
Meanwhile, the EU brands are increasingly turning to Turkey as a near-shoring destination as the latter was named among the top three sourcing regions by 30 per cent of EU respondents.
Diversification is on the top of the mind for global brands, but there are some noticeable nuances between regions.
The US brands are by far most likely to diversify sourcing, with 95 per cent of US-based respondents reporting plans to the effect, likely due to the pandemic and worsening geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing.
On the other hand, European buyers are not as ready to walk away from China, with only about half of the EU-based respondents reporting plans to seek suppliers elsewhere.
While China remains a key sourcing region, named among the top three sourcing geographies by three-quarters of respondents globally, its dominance is less dramatic compared to the findings of QIMA sourcing surveys of previous years.
In 2018-2019, more than 95 per cent of the respondents had listed China among their top 31 sourcing destinations.
The increasing share of the other in-demand sourcing regions in Asia, particularly Vietnam, India and Bangladesh, as well as home regions, is another way in which the long-term trend towards sourcing diversification is making itself known.
Among the ""other"" sourcing countries, Taiwan emerged an indisputable leader, reported by 6 per cent of respondents among their top three sourcing grounds, notably overwhelmingly among respondents headquartered in the US.
The other notable entries included, in descending order of popularity, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, South Korea, South Africa, Japan and Pakistan.
Comparing the latest survey data against the findings of QIMA sourcing surveys conducted in 2019 and 2018 provides a glimpse into the evolution of the top three sourcing regions as indicated by the US and EU buyers.
Despite the continued importance of China for buyers based on both sides of the Atlantic, its popularity has been inching downward, even among EU-based buyers, which have been less affected by the fallout of the US-China trade war in recent years.
Vietnam consistently remains among China's regional competitors reaping the most benefits of the continued exodus of Western buyers from China.
Some 40 per cent of EU respondents and almost as many US-based ones included Vietnam among their top sourcing regions.
Re-shoring and near-shoring have remained on the rise for US-based companies, with the growing popularity of the home region, and increased sourcing from Latin and South America.
In the rankings of top sourcing countries, the latter region almost doubled in popularity in the first six months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.
Meanwhile, respondents headquartered in the EU do not appear to be stepping up full-fledged re-shoring but are increasingly turning to Turkey as a near-shoring destination.
Some 30 per cent of the EU respondents named Turkey among their top three sourcing regions.
While reliance on China has decreased across the board, it remains a top-priority sourcing region for promotional products while toy businesses were more likely to view Chinese suppliers as a priority, compared to 2019.
In addition to Vietnam, traditionally a footwear powerhouse, brands and retailers continued to view Bangladesh as an important sourcing market for footwear. 
Textile and apparel businesses have continued diversifying their supplier portfolio, with an ever-lowering reliance on China and a more even distribution between overseas sourcing in Asia and near-shoring.
While near-shoring remains more popular than re-shoring, textile and apparel companies were more likely to buy from US and EU-based suppliers in 2020 compared to last year.
Outside of being a go-to sourcing market for textiles, India is increasingly viewed as an important sourcing region by buyers from different industries.
""Work orders are coming back gradually. The inflow of work orders is better in August than in June and July,"" said Mohammad Abdus Salam, acting president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), over the phone.
But most of the work orders are leftover orders of April and May when the retailers and brands cancelled the work orders, he said.
Salam, however, said it was difficult to pinpoint what would happen in the near future because the rate of unemployment and inflation was increasing in the Western world. ""So we are cautiously optimistic,"" he said.
Between 1 and 22 August, garment export from Bangladesh increased 45.8 per cent year-on-year to $2.4 billion, according to data from BGMEA."
www.thedailystar.net/business/news/prime-bank-get-agent-banking-bandwagon-year-1953269,Business,2020-08-30T00:00:00+06:00,2020-08-30T00:00:00+06:00,Prime Bank to get on agent banking bandwagon this year,"Prime Bank plans to step into the agent banking arena this year as part of its push to widen footprint and cut reliance on branches, said its top executive. 

","Prime Bank plans to step into the agent banking arena this year as part of its push to widen footprint and cut reliance on branches, said its top executive. 
The bank received the agent banking licence from the central bank recently, Rahel Ahmed, its chief executive officer, told The Daily Star last week. ""We would go for the implementation this year.""
With this, Prime Bank joins a growing number of lenders who are putting less emphasis on branch-led banking and embracing agent banking as part of their move to reach the rural areas and cut costs.
Prime Bank has not opened any new branches in the last four years and has no plans to open any in the future either, Ahmed said.
The central bank introduced agent banking in 2013 to provide a safe alternative delivery channel of banking services to the underprivileged, under-served population who generally live in the remote locations that are beyond the reach of the traditional banking network.
It has so far issued licences to 27 banks for operating agent banking activities. Of them, 22 are in operation.
Bank Asia has been a pioneer in popularising the model, followed by Dutch-Bangla Bank.
Agent banking has allowed banks to expand businesses and accelerate financial inclusion using agents as intermediaries, according to the central bank.
It has now gone beyond the basic banking services such as cash deposits, cash withdrawal, and receipt of remittances. Rather, banks have started giving out small loans through these outlets.
The method is gaining popularity as a cost-effective delivery channel as well as a convenient way of getting banking services, the Bangladesh Bank said in its quarterly report for the January-March period.
Deposits soared 129 per cent year-on-year to Tk 8,535 crore at the end of March, the latest for which data is available. Loan disbursement grew 306 per cent to Tk 853 crore.
As of March, the total number of accounts, which could be opened with deposits ranging from Tk 10 to Tk 100, under the programme stood at 2.13 crore and aggregate deposits Tk 2,385 crore.
There are outlets 11,875 under 8,260 agents in the country.
About 65 lakh accounts were opened through the outlets, out of which 29.6 lakh are owned by women, BB data showed.
The year-on-year growth of agents, outlets, and accounts in the first quarter stood at 69.8, 51.5 and 123.5 per cent respectively.
Deposit, loans disbursed and inward remittance had a growth of 128.6 per cent, 220.3 per cent and 172 per cent respectively.
A staggering 87 per cent of the agents and 88 per cent of the outlets are located in the rural area in an indication that banks are contributing significantly to promote financial inclusion.
Gender-wise, female accounts constitute 45 per cent of the total accounts, male accounts 54 per cent and the remainder 1 per cent are held by institutions, the BB publication showed.
Of the deposits, 77 per cent are collected in rural areas. Sixty-six per cent of deposits come from male customers.
More than 70 per cent of loans were disbursed in the rural area. Of them, 69.4 per cent went to male customers, 5.8 per cent to female customers and 24.9 per cent to small enterprises.
Dutch-Bangla Bank has the highest number of outlets with 4,030 outlets, which is 33.9 per cent of the total outlets as of March, followed by Bank Asia at 29.8 per cent.
Bank Asia has the highest number of accounts at 24.6 lakh accounts, or 37.8 per cent of the total. It also disbursed the highest amount of loan of about Tk 276 crore, or 41 per cent of the total disbursement as of March.
Islami Bank Bangladesh had the highest amount of deposit with Tk 2,159 crore and Dutch-Bangla Bank distributed the highest amount of inward remittance of Tk 7,526 crore.
The central bank expects that more loans will be disbursed in future when more banks start disbursing loans through agent outlets.
""Thus, agent banking has a noteworthy impact on financial inclusion and potential to fill the market gap,"" the BB quarterly report said."

","For those who have contracted COVID-19, the road to recovery can be like looking down the barrel. Not only do you have to deal with fatigue, breathlessness and other physical effects of the disease, but also live with the psychological impact of it. According to a study published in The Lancet, even patients who have had mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 are likely to grapple with cognitive changes in the aftermath.
Emerging pieces of evidence do point out that those who recover from COVID-19 may face several long-term issues including shortness of breath, fatigue, headache and confusion. While a COVID-19 patient usually recovers in 2 to 3 weeks, studies have pointed out that people may suffer from kidney, lungs, and heart ailments post-recovery as well.
Other possible long-term impacts of COVID-19 include neurological conditions and mental health issues as research shows that the disease can also attack the brain and central nervous system. While the data is still limited and non-conclusive, it is still strongly advised to regularly monitor your symptoms post-recovery to look for any warning signs. There are ways you need to take care of yourself after testing negative for COVID-19.
Do not bounce back to your previous life as soon as you get back home or test negative for the disease. Give yourself some time to slowly adjust to the old routine, taking one day at a time. Remember, you have just fought a ravaging illness and it is better to get into your old activities gradually, rather than just diving straight in. To gradually get back your memory and concentration levels on track, invest some time daily in relaxing tasks, games and exercises to revamp your brain. The key is taking it gradually, one thing at a time.
Whether it is a nagging headache or a bout of breathlessness, it is important to pay attention to any warning signs that your body is not doing all right. Always inform your doctor if any such issues arise post-recovery. If you have any chronic illness and have comorbid conditions, a person of senior age group, take regular medication, it is strongly advised to monitor your symptoms like, checking blood pressure, sugar levels and consult your healthcare provider if the drug dosage needs revision. If you are taking multiple medications, you must consult your physician before making any changes.
While contracting COVID-19 may have given your body a certain degree of immunity from the disease, emerging studies have suggested that it is most likely temporary. Hence, continue wearing face masks in public places and practice social distancing, wash your hands if you are at home, use sanitisers if outside. As you are on a road to recovery, it is important to prioritise the most important tasks and leave everything else. Preserve your energy as much as possible and postpone unnecessary tasks for a later date. Understand that you do need proper care and rest to feel like yourself again.
Diminished cognitive abilities like lack of concentration, memory recall and recognition issues and brain fog are likely to show up. These difficulties may go away within weeks or months of you starting your recovery but for some people, they can last for a longer time. These difficulties can have an impact on your relationships, daily activities and your professional life as you get back to it, so you and your family should take them seriously.
Pace yourself while slowing down. Restlessness in times like these is understandable but you cannot rush your mind and body back into order, especially in the aftermath of a disease like COVID-19. Get into your old activities gradually, and if it feels too overwhelming, then take time off to recover or talk to a specialist.

Today, we are joined by Zakiya Bari Mamo. Thank you for being here, Mamo. How are you spending your time nowadays?","Rafi Hossain: Welcome to Uncensored with Rafi Hossain. Today, we are joined by Zakiya Bari Mamo. Thank you for being here, Mamo. How are you spending your time nowadays?
Zakiya Bari Mamo: Thank you for having me, Rafi Bhai. It is difficult to stay well during quarantine, but I have found my own way to keep myself happy. I have been doing everything on my own time. I study, watch movies and work out, among other things. In all honestly, I am quite happy with how my life is going. Since we have never had to live during something like the pandemic, I think that thist ime is important in a way.
Rafi: Last time we spoke, you told me that you are doing a PhD. Did you complete the degree yet?
Mamo: I have not finished it yet. I completed the first part of it, and now, I need to get myself to complete it. I am eager to complete it, but I need to get over my laziness.
Rafi: Nowadays, there are not many people from the younger generation who want to complete a PhD. Why do you think that is?
Mamo: I think the reason varies from person to person, but from what I can understand, many people do not get to apply their education to their jobs. Many people take jobs completely different from the subject they studied. I think that could be a reason people lose interest in pursuing further education. I think I am very lucky in this as I get to utilise my education in my job.
Rafi: What do you think the Bangladeshi film industry will be like once this pandemic is over?
Mamo: I am hopeful about our industry. I think that the fact that we manage to make great projects even without much support shows how dedicated we are. The way we have planned and created our projects, I doubt that any other industry can even imagine doing it. After the pandemic ends, we need to adjust ourselves toa more different lifestyle, and then I think that our industry will have a change for the better.
Rafi: Do you think that our industry will ultimately shift to web platforms?
Mamo: The thing is, even though all news articles are available online, people still read newspapers. It is the same case with television. Television has its own structure, and I think that people will still watch it. I do not think there is any other film industry in the world where they make telefilms like us. They make series meant for TV, but we make one hour to ninety-minute-long dramas just for television. So, our television industry is unique. However, web platforms give us the scope to show our content to a bigger audience. By giving content to web platforms, we are advancing with the times. Web platforms seem like they are full of possibilities, especially since our industry is unique. Another thing that I am very hopeful about web platforms is that we will get more projects to work on. On top of that, we will also get many experimental storylines.
Rafi: Did studying in dramatics help you when you started acting?
Mamo: Many senior actors have said that you cannot act only if you just learn it. You need to have something in you to express yourself properly when you act. But, learning dramatics and studying different characters helped me differentiate between the characters I portrayed. However, if one is to act, it is most important that they have the natural ability to act. If they do, they can easily bring it out and showcase it, and studying dramatics makes that easier. I think the reason I got this far is due to my passion for it. I immerse myself into the role and try to play it as well as I can.
Rafi: How did you decide to come into this industry?
Mamo: When I was very young, I used to always practise singing and dancing, so I was very interested in cultural activities. So, after I finished studying intermediate, I knew that I wanted to study in dramatics. At first, my father was hesitant about it as it was not certain that a degree in dramatics would guarantee me a way to earn a living. I had to pressure him a lotto let me study the subject I wanted to. One day, my father came and asked me what my plans for the future were. I told him that I would look for roles after I had finished my education. He then told me about how there was a competition called Lux Channel i Superstar, and if I won that competition, I would get to do a film. He told me that since I went out of my way to study dramatics, I should try to go and win that contest. I told him that I did not think that I would win a beauty contest, but he still told me to go and try it anyways. I agreed to do it, and that was the start for me.
Rafi: When you registered for it, were you confident that you had a shot at winning?

Mamo: Whatever I do, I try to give it my everything. When I decided to register for the competition, I knew I had to try to win. I prepared as much as I could for the competition, so that I knew that even if I did not win, at least I tried my best. I also knew that even if I did not win, the experience I would gainfrom it might benefit me in the future.
Rafi: Unfortunately, we have to hear about a lot of exploitation done by people in the media. When facing exploitation like that, how did you deal with it, and what advice would you give upcoming actors regarding it?
Mamo: I think that while dealing with exploitation, the most important thing is to maintain the image. If I am not sure of what my goals are or if I am not passionate enough or if I am not sure of myself, I can get exploited by others. This is not just the case in our industry; it can happen anywhere. I think that those who are educated cannot be exploited as education helps them learn about proper values and gives them the bravery to stand up to whoever is trying to coercethem to do something. That is why I consider education very important. I think that in our society, a girl has to be more prepared to face things like this, so that she can stand up to it. I am already seeing that many new actors are prepared to stand up to this and they make me hopeful about the future of the industry.
Rafi: Are you interested to work with new actors?
Mamo: Definitely. I am eager to work with the new generation of actors. I feel that the new generation is bringing in newer and better stories which I would love to work with. As long as whoever I am working with is passionate about acting, I am more than happy to do it.
Rafi: From the new generation, who would you say is doing the best work?
Mamo: I think that there are a lot of talented actors from the new generation. Mehzabien Chowdhury has been doing a great job, so has Sabila Nur. I also really like the work of Naziba Basher. Irfan Sajjad is also a very good actor. I like the acting of Samrat and Farhan Ahmed Jovan. I think that these actors understand acting very well. I believe that the new directors who started very recently are all doing great projects. I really like the work of Rinku. I also love the work of Taneem Rahman Angshu and Abdullah Mohammad Saad. I am sure that there are many more amazing artists in the industry.
Rafi: Who are your favourite directors?
Mamo: I have a lot of directors with whom I enjoyed working with. I loved working with Mabrur Rashid Banna. He works in a very organised way. Faridur Reza Sagor is also an amazing director to work with. I never got to work with Ashfaque Nipun, but I would love to get the chance to work with him. I did one project with Adnan Al Rajeev, and I really enjoyed it. There are many other directors whose work I really enjoy.
Rafi: When picking roles, do you make sure that it does not affect your image?
Mamo: I think at times I do make sure to maintain my image as there are a lot of fans who only want to see me in a certain way. But, as an actor, I have to explore and do different types of roles. Actors have to do different kinds of roles to find happiness, so I think fans should understand that. Personally, I do not think that my fan base wants me to do only one kind of role. I think they like me as an actor overall. This lets me take on challenging roles, and my audience appreciates that. I am very thankful to my fans for that.
Rafi: Do you have any final message for the readers?
Mamo: I hope all of you will stay well in these uncertain times. Times are hard for all of us, and we will all worry, but I would ask all of you to not focus on the bad sides and learn to be okay. All of us need to stay brave and learn to stay happy in all situations."

Finally, the family could find Liton on Tuesday, when police said he was arrested with a firearm and a case filed with Kushtia Sadar Police Station against him.
After meeting her husband at the police station on Wednesday, Jahanara said the man told her that he was kept at a police outpost in Baghapara of Jashore for about a month. After being detained, he was taken to the police outpost, handcuffed and blindfolded.
Quoting witnesses, she earlier told this newspaper that two men in police uniform stopped a three-wheeler, in which Liton was travelling, at Dak Bangla intersection in Jashore town around 5:00pm on July 24.
Detaining him, they called someone over a mobile phone. Minutes later, two plainclothes men with handcuffs reached the spot in a motorcycle and took him away.
Liton has been a supporter of the Awami League, and that day he was on his way to the house of a local AL leader from his home in Birampur village under Kotwali Police Station, she added.
The woman alleged that five minutes before her husband went out of home, some policemen wandered around their house.
But Golam Mostafa, officer-in-charge of Kushtia Sadar Police Station, told this newspaper on Thursday that Liton was detained around 2:00am on August 25. So far, 18 cases have been found against him in Jashore and Narail.
A locally made pistol and two bullets were found in his possession, he added.
Jahanara said her husband was earlier involved in some criminal activities, but he gave it up all and was leading a normal life. He had suffered injuries to his legs in an attack by rivals and was now sick.
According to her, 42-year-old Liton runs his family with the money earned from tailoring work and fish farming in a family pond. Along with a college going daughter and school going son and Liton's aged mother, she has been having a hard time without her husband, the lone breadwinner of the family.
Local sources said Liton had enmity with some political goons over control of drug peddling in his locality. The opponent group might have had links with his disappearance, they added.
On July 27, Jahanara said, she went to Kotwali Police Station to lodge a general diary (GD), but she was asked to contact Sub-Inspector Sekandar Abu Zafar, who was then in-charge of Upashahar Police Outpost.
The woman contacted the official accordingly.
Instead of registering the GD, police asked her to continue search for her husband. Finally, a GD was registered on August 17. She, however, was not allowed to write about the involvement of men in police uniform in the GD.
Talking to this newspaper on August 20, Officer-in-Charge of Jashore Kotwali Police Station Md Moniruzzaman said they were trying to find Liton. Asked about Liton being picked up by two men in uniform, he said he was not aware of any such incident.
SI Sekandar Abu Zafar said registering the GD was delayed as his senior officers instructed him to inquire about the matter first. He also said as he went on leave during Eid, it took some time to register the GD.
Liton's incident is one instance of enforced disappearance.
According to national and international rights groups, around 606 incidents of enforced disappearance have been documented in Bangladesh over the past decade.
Many of the victims returned to their families while bodies of some were found later. Others were shown arrested in several cases filed by the law enforcers.
Those who returned never opened up to say clearly who picked them up.
Political activists, non-partisan critical voices, intellectual figures, academics, and journalists were also among those subjected to enforced disappearance."

","Undocumented Bangladeshi workers in Kuwait are at risk of facing deportation, as authorities in the Gulf country have recently decided to launch drive against illegal foreign workers there.
Media reports say the drive will be conducted as the government-announced amnesty programme which ended in April this year failed to bear expected results.
About 26,000 undocumented foreign workers took the benefit of the amnesty to amend their residency permits.
Authorities estimated currently there might be about 75,000 undocumented foreign workers who are in violation of residency permits, added media reports.
Of an estimated 25,000 undocumented Bangladeshi workers, nearly 4,500 workers took the benefit of the amnesty programme.
On Thursday, Kuwait's English-language daily Arab Times reported the country's interior ministry will launch the drive depending on the resumption of the airports in ""full capacity"".
It is because the authorities want to deport the detainees as soon as they get arrested to avoid crowding them in police stations and detention centres to prevent Covid-19 spread, the report said.
At present, Kuwait is operating commercial flights in and out of the country from August 1, with 30 percent of its airport's normal capacity.
The oil-rich country has plans to fully resume the operation of its airports from August next year, according to Gulf News.
The Arab Times report, citing Arabic-language daily Al-Qabas, said the interior ministry has completed its plan to launch the ""unprecedented security campaigns"" to arrest residency violators who are in hiding and refused to take the advantage of April's amnesty offered by the ministry.
The report mentioned the 75,000 residency violators are now unable to amend their residency status because they have been in violation for a very long time.
Bangladeshi migrant workers in Kuwait have been facing multi-faceted challenges amid the emerging situation of the Covid-19 fallout.
Following the Covid-19 pandemic, Kuwait asked several labour-sending countries, including Bangladesh, to take back their undocumented workers from the Gulf country.
Kuwait also warned that the countries that will not take back their undocumented workers might not get priority when it starts fresh recruitment of workers.
In July, Kuwait approved a bill that, once passed, may force about two lakh Bangladeshi migrant workers out of the Gulf country.
The bill, submitted by five MPs, calls for an expatriate quota system in Kuwait, one of the major sources of Bangladesh's remittance inflow.
It proposes Bangladeshis must not exceed three percent of Kuwait's total populace, which now stands at about 48 lakh.
Currently, around 3.5 lakh Bangladeshis are employed in different sectors of the oil-rich country.
Once the bill is passed and turns into a law, only about 1.5 lakh Bangladeshis will be allowed to stay there.
Last year, Bangladeshi migrant workers sent more than $1.5 billion in remittance from Kuwait.
Between April 1 and August 26 this year, some 7,549 Bangladeshi migrant workers including 71 female workers returned home from Kuwait, said expatriates' welfare ministry data.
Apart from workers returned under a general amnesty, the returnees also included those who served jail terms in the Gulf country."

Essentially as shocking as the news of his demise was the revelation that the actor was battling colon cancer for the last four years.","Celebrated actor Chadwick Boseman passed away at 43 on August 28, 2020, at his home. Essentially as shocking as the news of his demise was the revelation that the actor was battling colon cancer for the last four years.
The timeline proves that he was diagnosed in 2016 – the year that he debuted as King T'Challa in Marvel's Captain America: The Civil War. After his diagnosis, Boseman filmed and appeared in Marshall, Black Panther, two more Avengers movies, 21 Bridges, Da 5 Bloods and an upcoming adaptation of Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. This is an immense run that seems all the more miraculous in light of the knowledge that Boseman pulled it off while quietly undergoing several surgeries and rounds of chemotherapy.
Many fellow actors and celebrities paid tribute to Boseman via social media following the announcement of his death, including a number of his co-stars from Black Panther and the Avengers series. Chris Evans posted a message sharing that he was ""absolutely devastated"", calling Boseman a ""true original"". Chris Hemsworth called his death ""absolutely heartbreaking"", adding, that Boseman was ""One of the kindest most genuine people [he'd] met"". Marvel Studios president and CCO Kevin Feige similarly called Boseman's death ""absolutely devastating"", writing, ""Each time he stepped on set, he radiated charisma and joy, and each time he appeared on screen, he created something truly indelible...He was as smart and kind and powerful and strong as any person he portrayed. Now he takes his place alongside them as an icon for the ages.""
Born in Anderson, South Carolina, Boseman was a graduate of Howard University and the British American Drama Academy. He mostly appeared in minor roles on television until he was cast as baseball legend Jackie Robinson in the 2013 biopic, 42. The film, directed by Brian Helgeland, deals with Robinson's struggle to control his anger as he's subject to racist abuse by fans and players, and Boseman's performance shimmers with excellence. He was further cast in two more biopics, playing two other Black Americans of historical importance – James Brown in Get on Up (2014) and Thurgood Marshall in Marshall (2017). As James Brown, Boseman captured all of the singer's on-stage energy, doing all of his dancing and some of his singing.
 Black Panther (King T'Challa), the king of the fictional African nation Wakanda, was the first African superhero in American comics, a milestone figure created in the 1960s. King T'Challa is a sensitive and just warrior, who struggles courageously with the burden of leading an entire nation, and Boseman brought an innate humanity to the role. His performance in four Marvel movies earned the character total global celebrity. Black Panther was a staggering cultural phenomenon when it released in 2018, the fourth highest-grossing movie in domestic box-office history. The movie scored three Oscars in 2019, the first Academy Awards ever for Marvel Studios, including Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Original Score, making it the most-awarded superhero movie in the history of the Oscars.
In Da 5 Bloods, directed by Spike Lee, Boseman played the heroic Stormin' Norman, a Black soldier who died in the Vietnam War. Throughout his career, the actor played a number of revolutionary characters that made both Hollywood and American history."

Her husband Khalid Mahmood Mithu was a renowned artist and a National Film Award winning director of Bangladesh. Arjo and Shiropa, their son and daughter, are acclaimed for their documentary films, music and photography.
Kanak is compassionate towards animals. The artist regularly feeds, treats, rescues, neuters and takes care of her pets and stray animals. She has several cats and dogs. In a recent conversation with The Daily Star, she shared her valuable suggestions for the well-being of stray animals in Dhaka and more.
""The city corporation has regular programmes on neutering stray dogs. The dogs are vaccinated as well. If we mobilised the programmes and covered the entire city, then the dog population can be managed,"" said Kanak. ""Dogs are immensely faithful creatures. Cats kill rats and other insects, which destroy harvests and households. They keep up the ecological balance. Both pets and stray animals deserve to co-exist with human beings. We cannot take the risk of rehabilitating them elsewhere.""
As the artist is confined to her home at this time, she worked on a number of paintings, themed around raising awareness on health issues in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
In her view, we, as a race, have failed to pay heed to the needs of our planet. ""We have induced this pandemic. Now, we must atone for our transgressions,"" she asserted. ""Our materialistic desires have led to wars and bloodshed. It is time for us to think deeply about how we act and to love the nature, with all its beings and creations."" One of her recent paintings portrays a pallid moon hiding in a polluted sky, with its brightly lit face hardly visible. The polluted air in the painting covers the surroundings.
Kanak's paintings carry a melancholy aesthetic with great depth. They tell stories of the past and a simple, but fading, way of life. The artist loves to depict female figures with different natural settings and ambiences. Her works invariably feature indigenous people and their daily lives.
She is keenly inspired by the vivid colours of indigenous attires, the hills, forests, the 'Jum' cultivation, waterfalls, dance and music. The semi-realistic and the abstract mingle in her works. The figures in her paintings are expressive and communicative. 
Her works also capture the serene moods associated with Buddhism and its various spiritual aspects. Apart from her exotic and beautiful ethnic subjects, Kanak is influenced by impressionists."

The star started out as a model, before making her way into television. She further proved her versatility with her impeccable performance in Mostofa Sarwar Farooki's film, Bachelor. Among other things, she has made a name for herself in the field of theatre, actively working with Nagorik Natya Sampradaya. Her recent telefilm, Victim, earned positive reviews from audiences and critics alike. In a recent video interview with The Daily Star, titled A & E Talk with Elita, the actor shared her experience of working on the project.
After Victim took television fans by storm, everyone had one question to ask – who was the actual 'victim' in it?  According to Aupee, no one can be singled out as the victim. ""The creators have tried to address the turmoil that different individuals, including one's family members go through, when they face such a fate,"" said the actor in the video interview. 
Although she always manages to put in seamless, natural and true-to-life performances in her projects, she prefers to give most of the credit to the directors. ""I try and follow everything that they tell me,"" says Aupee. ""While shooting for Victim with Ashfaque Nipun, for instance, I followed all his guidelines and briefings. I believe that hard work and honesty pave the way towards success.""
Among the recent Eid specials, Aupee especially liked Ashfaque Nipun's Eti Maa, because of Rumana Rashid Ishita's phenomenal performance in it. Even though television has brought her a lot of success throughout the years, Karim says that theatre, where her roots lie, brings her a lot of peace and contentment, and she plans to continue honing her presence on the stage.
The actor will be seen in Indranil Roy Chowdhury's film, Mayar Jonjal (Debris of Desire). ""We started filming in 2019, and the shooting is complete. The film was appreciated at many festivals, including the Shanghai Film Festival,"" says Aupee. The film has been cleared by the Central Board of Film Certification, and is waiting for a clearance from Bangladesh Film Censor Board and a theatrical release here."

Adventures Overland, the company formed by Indian duo Tushar Agarwal and Sanjay Madan, has so far focused on arranging driving trips across long distances, but their latest addition to the extended travel experience involves a modified luxury bus that will carry 20 people across a scenic route from Delhi, India, to London, UK, reports CNN.
In part inspired by the hippie trail buses that made similar journeys of self-discovery and natural and cultural appreciation on the road in the 1950s and 1960s, the new venture looks to show people the great diversity of the world across sites like the Great Wall of China, historic cities of Europe like Prague, and the rolling countryside of France, all in one journey that will last approximately 70 days.
""The best time to do this journey is between April and June because that's when the weather is favorable to start the journey from India through to Myanmar and to cross the high mountains of China and Kyrgyzstan,"" explains Agarwal in an article on CNN.
The inaugural bus journey is set to take place in mid-2021, Covid-19 restrictions pending.
It won't be cheap, however. At nearly $20,000, it will take more than the average backpacker hopes to spend on a trip, but Agarwal and Madan are confident that it's well worth it.
""It's a life-changing journey, something that people will always remember and they will cherish it forever,"" Agarwal says.
""This is a tried and tested route,"" he adds, stressing that it's designed to be as safe as possible and that local guides also join the party as each border is crossed to assist with travel logistics.
Some 40,000 people have registered interest so far, reports CNN. Past participants on Adventures Overland's self-drive version of the expedition have included travelers as young as five and as old as 75."

In August 2017, Samiha opened a Facebook page and posted some pictures of her paintings.

As a moderator, she gains a five percent commission from each sold painting. One of her bestseller items is a framed painting of Ayatul Kursi, with the English translation. The piece is intricately bordered by colourful flowers and a bright frame, giving it a vibrant floral touch. ""It was a major gifting choice during Ramadan and we had to make it in large numbers due to popular demand,"" said Samiha. Their paintings of motivational quotes created are also very popular.

""Whenever I feel low, I start playing with my paints. It is therapeutic and a mood-lifter,"" Samiha shared. Some of her most noteworthy paintings were created during nights. One of them is a painting of a dark night amidst mountains while another is a rainy scene focusing on a couple walking under an umbrella.
As the artists are confined to their homes during the pandemic, they have turned to painting as a coping mechanism. ""Since there is no work outside, I'm devoting more time towards painting and being with my child. It gives me a nice break from all the daily chores,"" said Adiba, a part-time lecturer at Stamford University and a gold medalist from Charukola.
Initially, the team was doubtful about taking orders but painting requests kept pouring in, and they decided to start deliveries. They wrap the paintings in layers with plastic and paper. The outer layer is disposable and can be disinfected easily. ""We also ensure that our delivery agents are wearing masks and gloves while working. Payments are made digitally,"" Samiha shared.
Painted Thoughts intends to introduce a campaign involving donations from customers. ""I am personally donating ten percent of my earnings. These are tough times and we all need to support each other,"" concluded Samiha."

Designed in Japan and produced in Indonesia, the car is best known for its polarizing front end. We took it out for a spin this week and here's what we think.

","What is it
The Mitsubishi Xpander is a seven-seater multi-purpose vehicle built to carry around large families. Designed in Japan and produced in Indonesia, the car is best known for its polarizing front end.
Why does it look like that?  
It's unique, that's for sure. In a world where every car looks like a badge-engineered version of another car, Mitsubishi managed to give the Xpander an unmistakable face. For one reason or another, the Three-Diamond Mark decided to swap the placement of the DRL and headlamps, giving the car an alien look. The 2020 facelift made some additional changes, adding a bigger badge and a slightly reworked front grille. Beauty is to the eyes of the beholder and the author is quite fond of the design, a view not shared by the rest of the Shift team.
What's it like on the inside?
Storage space. There's so much of it. It seems Mitsubishi has turned every flat surface on the car into a storage cubby of some kind. The dashboard alone contains eight different places for you to store your stuff, and that's excluding the large glove compartment. Every door card has a storage tray with an integrated water bottle holder, while the cavernous center console is topped up with a pencil tray. The theme continues elsewhere, with the passenger seat featuring a shoe tray under the seat and three separate pouches in the back. Speaking of seats, they're made of cloth but branded seat covers are available as an option. The middle seats are adjustable, meaning adults seating in the cramped third row can have some actual legroom if the people at the front are willing to sacrifice some of their own. To alleviate some of the discomforts, there is a dedicated ac unit for the rear passengers and three 12-volt sockets are spread across the car for everyone's charging needs. For hauling non-human goods, both second and third-row seats can be folded down, giving you a massive 1,608 liter of cargo space. Additional cargo room can also be found under the rear trunk liner, while the tools are hidden under a difficult-to-operate panel on the left D pillar. The rear storage comes at the cost of the spare tire, which has been relocated under the car. You need to undo two bolts in the trunk to access it.
How does it drive?

About what you'd expect, with a few surprises. Mitsubishi has taken great pride in designing the car's lightweight structure, the effect of which can be felt during driving. The car almost behaves like a subcompact sedan when driven reasonably, however, a spirited drive around a corner will quickly remind you of what it actually is. Visibility is great thanks to the extended A pillar, giving the interior a very open and spacious feel. The 205 mm ground clearance gives the driver a commanding view of the road, as well as allowing the car to navigate most of Dhaka's road with ease. The sound deadening works rather well, with the engine only becoming audible when you floor it. One annoying issue about the driving position is the lack of a center armrest, leaving you no place to rest your left arm.   
Verdict

If you are looking for a family wagon that stands out on the road but is conventional otherwise, this is for you. The Xpander blends the minivan practicality and bog-standard Japanese reliability with a front facia that will make most people stop and think ""what it that?"" for a few seconds.

US President Donald Trump this month announced a ban from mid-September on WeChat and another Chinese-owned app, TikTok, accusing them of threatening national security, further stoking tensions between Beijing and Washington.
But foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian tweeted Friday that ""If WeChat is banned, then there will be no reason why Chinese shall keep iPhone and apple products"".
Zhao had already on Thursday said ""many Chinese people are saying they may stop using iPhones if WeChat is banned in the US"", and accused the US of ""systematic economic bullying of non-US companies"" by targeting the Chinese app.
The comments mark a rare direct reference by Beijing to boycotting an American product and come as the superpowers spar on multiple fronts including military activity in the South China Sea, Hong Kong and blame for the coronavirus.
Chinese social media users on Friday responded with mixed feelings to Zhao's warning on Twitter, which is blocked in China but accessible through virtual private network software.
""I use Apple, but I also love my country,"" one user on the Twitter-like Weibo platform. ""It's not a conflict.
""No matter how good Apple is, it's just a phone. It can be replaced, but WeChat is different,"" another user argued. ""Modern Chinese people will lose their soul if they leave WeChat, especially business people.""
Wechat, known in mainland China as Weixin, has more than 1.2 billion active users.
Trump's executive order against WeChat forces the platform to end all operations in the United States and bans Americans doing business with it.
Apple accounted for eight percent of China's smartphone market in the second quarter of 2020, according to Counterpoint Research, far behind domestic leader Huawei."

Growing up in Chattogram, everyone will have faced this question. The mountains on one side and the sea on the other puts you in a dilemma – a strange illusion that makes it so very hard to give an honest answer.
This city has grown inside of me as much as I've grown up in this city. When I walk along these familiar streets, or the winding alleyways that spread out like the roots of an ancient tree, I smell familiar scents. I see faces of people, busy faces, running from one circle to another in search of a bus. I see faces full of enthusiasm, eyes that light up at the sight of fresh jilapi being fried on roadside open stoves. I see faces of couples sitting together, losing themselves in each other's eyes, in an air-conditioned restaurant somewhere in this city. I see people with sadness etched on their faces, carrying along tired bodies, their eyes betraying the emptiness inside.
Everyday I see these faces, and feel a ring of familiarity solidifying around me. A ring that's hard to break out of.
I, too, lose myself in these faces every day. Sometimes I am the busy pedestrian, sometimes I am the stranger. A day in the city often takes me to GEC Moar, which you could call the heart of the city. Different buses on different routes start their journey here, and while the moar stays busy all day, the influx of home-bound commuters adds a whole new level to the chaos as evening falls. Public buses brimming with people roll off towards Muradpur 2 No. Gate or Bahaddarhat, some are going to Agrabad, Barek Building, or even further away.
All this time, shoppers and shopkeepers in Riazuddin Bazar, New Market, and Tamakundi Lane are busy playing the game of buy and sell, while Chawkbazar mostly deals with the comings and goings of students. A two-hour class might have left someone tired, eager to get home, while someone else moves hurriedly to catch a class themselves. With friends hanging out in scattered groups, and lazy strolls in Gulzar Tower, Chawkbazar lives on in a tradition of its own.
The smell of new books floats in to tingle the senses from the direction of Anderkilla. In the rows of bookshops by the road, or in the ones that you will find if you go inside and up some stairs, attentive readers can be seen browsing through bookshelves. Some of them are desperately looking for a book they need; some just want to read the first few pages of a book that seems interesting. The books on display bear witness to the murmur of haggling over prices that goes on between the buyers and sellers.
When the activity and chaos of the city becomes too much, I walk in search of some solitude and peace. I find it at CRB, a place surrounded by ancient trees, where seven roads meet to form a world of its own. The calm lasts until noon, and then as afternoon rolls in, people come with it, when Shirish Tola gets to play host to games of cricket, football, and friendship. The search for greenery and tranquility has more than one answer, however. People go to Foy's Lake, they take the winding roads of Bhatiary to enjoy the beauty of the hills and the lake together.
A little way away from the city centre is one of the biggest attractions of Chattogram – Naval. Perched up on the walls made of red and white bricks, I've spent hours looking at ships afloat the river. The area is abuzz with people as night falls and the light goes dim, as the wind from the sea gets stronger. A plate of piyaju or fried crabs keeps company as onlookers get mesmerised by the sight of the Karnaphuli meeting the sea.
The sunrise and sunset is best seen from Patenga beach. It's also where I go to enjoy the sea in its singular glory. Standing on the edge of the sea, you can only see the waves crashing in, and also the tiny ships in the horizon, waiting to enter the port. The waves grow louder and the winds get wilder as time passes.
Starting from the Rail Station, a track snakes through the city, ending at the Chittagong University Station. The shuttle train carries students to and from the university all day, their journeys adorned by catkin in autumn, by a mysterious fog in winter, and by the pitter-patter of rain in monsoon. It's almost as if the journey reminds students of the seasonal beauties nature has to offer as they whistle into the country's largest university campus.
Chattogram changes in appearance as the year comes around. Bangladesh's business capital and port city lightens up from the yellow glow of the port as evening rolls in. The hills and the sea cradle with love those who have to constantly hustle in search of a living, the monotony of city life is interjected with the memories of life in a beautiful city.
These memories and this love then become the capital of progress, for a dream of a better future.

This time, I began getting to know my city, Chittagong, in a different light.","In the west, once you are 18, you have to move out of your parents' house and find your own place. Many move to a different city for higher studies. In Bangladesh, I went through the same experience.
Even though I come from Chittagong, a port city with reputed universities, I moved to Dhaka to begin a new chapter in my life. A 258 kilometre journey to experience freedom and new frontiers.
Sure, Dhaka is very much a concrete jungle. With little-to-no getaways and terrible traffic, the living expenses were high but it had its upsides. There were high-paying jobs, quality food, coffee shops, big concerts and my true love, kacchi biriyani. Then came along Covid-19 and just like that, I was unemployed.
I moved back with my parents for an unforeseeable future. I had the same feeling when I had moved to Dhaka seven years before. This time, I began getting to know my city in a different light. So different that most people here speak a completely different dialect which the rest of the country barely understands; people here say they are a Chittaingya first, and a Bangladeshi later. This was evident when the government officially changed the name of the city to ""Chattogram"", however, locals refuse to acknowledge it. Such a sense of pride and belonging has led to different tastes in food, culture, society compared to the rest of the country. Chittagong does not even serve kacchi in weddings as the main dish!
I used to visit Chittagong during semester breaks and holidays. The two cities have such distinct lifestyles that I developed alter-egos for each.
In Dhaka, where my life was fast paced, I was an outgoing person. You'll know what I mean if you've lived it. And so when the city changes, so does the person. Chittagong is a city with a small town vibe. Here, because of a more conservative culture, most cannot stay out past 10 PM. Life is a lot quiet here. The dining out culture is not as popular as Dhaka. Cafés and restaurants are usually half full, unless you are talking about Zaman Hotel. It is always full in Zaman Hotel—all branches, all day long.
Weekdays are ordinary. There are no hour-long traffic jams to work. No one wastes their time on the road. When the sun sets, the young and the old all head home or somewhere to hang out with friends, enjoy a cup of tea and maybe talk about politics. My father used to do all this, I do this and my younger brother has just started. I guess it's common in Dhaka too, but here it feels more passionate, more personal.
Then comes the weekend. Even if you do not own a calendar or your phone doesn't work, you can tell it's Friday if you live in Chittagong. The weekend mornings here have a special sound, a unique smell, and a different taste altogether. There is barely any sound outside; you may hear a few rickshaws or hawkers. That's it. If you wake up early, you can go to your local restaurant and buy soft naan charred in spots, made in a clay oven. Having that naan with moong daal, followed by a hot cup of milk tea with bakarkhani that's as sweet as a mother's love, is a heavenly experience. The fathers visit the fish markets in Fishery Ghat to buy the catch of the day or Chawkbazar to do groceries.
The afternoons are as lazy as they come. Most people usually visit their relatives who live no more than a few kilometres away. So, us Chittaingyas are always ""closer"". Apart from that people go for a drive around the Naval Academy area, CRB Hill, Bhatiary, Patenga beach or Foy's Lake. Just the perks of living in a smaller city.
One thing that might come as a surprise to anyone is that Chittagonian mothers know more people than anyone else. Take my mother for example. She stays in touch with everyone from our building, with other aunties in the neighbourhood and from the previous places we lived. Hence, your neighbours might know more about you than you think. Imagine the resources and networks Chittagong mothers have in their arsenal if they want to set up a marriage. And all that without using Facebook. Amazing!
Now that I think about it, living in Chittagong is great. You have most of the things one can find in Dhaka, minus the traffic, living expenses, and poor air quality. What you don't get, I believe the serene hills, the beach and the surrounding nature compensates for it. Moreover, you might get invited to a few Mezbaan events. And that, my friends, is a win.

","Last week Anila Torun, junior project supervisor of the Gabtoli Subterranean Tunnel for Cattle Rehabilitation, took a selfie with a cow. This is all fine because people like Ms Torun, who live inside Gabtoli bus stand, always take pictures with cows and trucks as an excuse to not show up to work. It's easy to say they got run over or casually mutilated by a runaway bull/truck. Gabtoli is known for being the place with the second highest cow-related human casualties after India.
While Ms Torun's selfie was perfectly framed to show her new dental surgery from Thailand, it also showed part of the Tk 210 crore project to build the tunnel. This revolutionary tunnel is designed to make it easier for cattle to cross the road by going under the road. The road is a very dangerous 20-feet wide portion where police stop trucks to exchange friendly little notes asking how the fam is doing at home. Many cattle have been psychologically injured while crossing this road.
Showing the project was a no-no, or rather a 'Nyet' because it is being funded by Russian donors who process 'uplifting energising spirits', whatever that is. Why the nyet, then?
Abu Share Ryuz, Head Data Consultant for the cattle crossing project, shared with us that he doesn't really know because no one shares with him. ""I'm just a guy who makes infographics.""
Ms Torun gave a press briefing later to apologise for her indiscriminate selfie-taking. The real reason is to avoid the 'evil eye' from neighbouring nations.
""We have even put small black dots on the foreheads of all the cattle there,"" she added.
To combat this poor photography, another project was undertaken costing Tk 6 crore to buy Instagraam filters for a training project on how to take aesthetic selfies that improve the image of the country. Only iPhones can be used for these filters, so they ordered 27 brand new Toyota Land Cruiser V8 SUVs for the project personnel at a cost of 4.6 crores each. They avoided the heated leather seats as a show of respect to the cattle.
Some say the ban on photography of special projects is that photos show no work is being done, yet donor money is all gone. But we know that is a blatant pile of buffalo… well, you know."

In her latest book, Sonia Shah, an American science journalist and author, critically takes apart the boundaries around human wandering both in our lands and our mind-sets.

","When we think of migration, the images in our collective narratives are constructed primarily with masses of people on the move, leaving places they belong in for foreign lands. In her latest book, Sonia Shah, an American science journalist and author, critically takes apart the boundaries around human wandering both in our lands and our mind-sets.
The Next Great Migration: The Beauty and Terror of Life on the Move (2020) offers a journey through a curated history of what migration has meant for this planet. The core argument of the book lies in deconstructing the idea of migration as ""an irregular and disruptive force"", a rhetoric that has influenced Western culture over centuries—in the form of America's eugenic and xenophobic policies, the Nazi genocide, contemporary national security and anti-migration policies, as well as strategies of international UN bodies.
Shah begins with observations of the natural world, laying out how migration is ingrained into the way the planet intrinsically works. From here, she unpacks the factors that have shaped human beings' views on the phenomenon. She takes us behind the scenes, revealing where and how the motivations behind certain scientific perspectives were championed as fact. Others were discarded, such as the concrete evidence that human beings have more shared identical traits, that migration is an aspect of history, and that the differences are at best a result of climate and diet only. This birthed the rise of nativism as a political ideology and beliefs about ""foreigners infesting our homelands"", which in the hands of powerful white men gave rise to ""race science"" as a legitimate discipline in academia and policies. Eventually, it founded the rationale for genocide in fascist regimes, the whispers of which persist in our contemporary narratives.
Shah's curation of such complex subjects do not come across as rushed or over the surface. Her work deconstructs the academic areas of history, several fields of biology (evolution, hereditary, etc.), and contemporary geopolitics. Yet despite the political and cultural depths she navigates, her storytelling remains easy to follow, helpfully drawing on popular, contemporary examples. She approaches each topic with critical insight and deep empathy, which is reflective of her own history as a child of immigrant parents in America. The latter fuels her analysis of what ""belonging"" and ""foreignness"" mean in the face of ideologies that separate and label human beings in an imaginary food chain.
Although she effectively explains these blind spots, there are instances in which she seems to over-generalise certain topics. For instance, Shah uses the migration of animal, plant, and other species to draw examples and parallels, but she does not address the threats to local biodiversity that this causes. In another example, she summarises the Syrian conflict as ""the boys' small act of resistance […] sparking one of the most brutal civil wars in recent history"". This deflects from the complex geopolitics of the Middle East and the underpinning ""otherisation"" of the Arab world, which are closely linked to perpetuating the outbreaks of resistance across the region.
What's notable is that these stories all resonate with our realities. This subcontinent shares its own fraught histories of mass movements since the Partition, and more immediate to us are Bangladesh's contemporary narratives of migration—closely tied to the country's identity as a fast growing economy. But this achievement comes with the absence of social, economic, and political safety nets for vulnerable migrant populations, the majority of whom are responsible for making Bangladesh one of the largest recipients of remittance (record of USD 18.32 billion in 2019 according to Bangladesh Bank).
Despite knowing this, our language and rhetoric continue to dehumanise them. The discourses around the legal status of migrants, cases of deportation, hardships of undocumented migrants and, most recently in the wake of the pandemic, the blame game of calling migrants ""responsible for bringing the virus into the country""—these are all shaped by a range of prejudices and classist rhetoric. Do we question what makes a person legal or illegal? How much of the problems with documentation, lack of transparency, and accountability in our systems are of the migrants' own making? Shah's book provides the analytical tools and insights which we can apply to mulling over our own local issues regarding migration.
Although she does not directly discuss this, her arguments demonstrate that the ""migration equating to disorder"" rhetoric is fundamentally an intersectional problem—the battle to rise to power through the dynamics of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, economic inequality, nationalism, and colonialism, spurred on by our growing knowledge of genetics, ecology, geography, and climate change, among a range of other issues. If we are to weaken this power, we will have to have to engage with contemporary issues of migration, locally and globally, through this same intersectional lens. It is important to account for all these factors in making certain migrants, certain people, and even certain species more vulnerable or endangered than others.
In The Next Great Migration, Shah ends on a hopeful note. She introduces the possibilities of figurative and literal networks which are helping to adapt our survival strategies for a drastically changing world. 
""Stillness at the centre of our ideas about the past casts migrants and migrations as anomalous and disruptive,"" she emphasises. Her book makes a strong case for understanding that the ""natural order"" for things means constant change and movement. These aspects are a core part of who we are and our survival—not just as humans but collectively as a planet.

This week, Toggle reached out to Rakuten Viber CEO Djamel Agaoua, who answered our questions about the messaging platform cutting business ties with Facebook.","Since the United States erupted in a spate of protests against systemic racism and racial violence last May, a slew of companies have banded together and boycotted business ties with Facebook. With over 1100 companies joining in an attempt to deny Facebook ad revenue – companies like Honda of North America, CocaCola, CVS Health and more – the movement has tried to press home the message that Facebook as a platform and as a company needs to do more to curb the spread of hate speech. While their pullout has barely registered a dent in the social media giant's revenues, it shows a growing dissatisfaction with the way tech companies handle our increasingly digital social interactions and public discourses. To elaborate, Toggle reached out to another tech company that claims to do things a little differently. This week, Rakuten Viber CEO Djamel Agaoua answered our questions about the messaging platform cutting business ties with Facebook.
We basically reached the point where Facebook policy and values were not compatible with Viber. It is in light of the fact the CEO and founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg said at a point that Facebook is not the arbiter of truth, and any kind of public speech -- even violent or sometimes racist -- could be posted on Facebook and they didn't have any role in moderating them. Since the killing of George Floyd in the US, a lot of public discussions were seen on Facebook, some of which were extremely violent and racist. All social networking platforms made the decision to moderate this kind of content. Facebook has a different policy -- they consider everybody to be free to post anything on their platform.
At Viber, we have a vision that our social responsibilities include blocking content that can be too violent or too racist because it hurts people. We understand ""Freedom of Expression"" and we try to respect this principle, but there are some limits, especially when rhetoric is too violent and too hurtful for other people. At Viber we are a very diverse company - all colours and religions are represented in our employee base and they were hurt Facebook's decision. So we came to the point where we could not maintain any business relationship with Facebook and this is the decision we made about six weeks ago.
There are three consequences to this decision. The first one is to remove Facebook Connect from Viber, meaning users that used Facebook credentials to connect to Viber cannot do it anymore. The latest version of Viber on Android and IOS are now without Facebook Connect. We have decided to stop all advertising expenses on Facebook platforms indefinitely. The third one is related to Giphy, which Facebook acquired a few months ago. We have decided to remove Giphy as a GIF content platform for Viber users and to replace it with other partners.
Well, obviously anything we say or do related to Facebook could be interpreted this way but we used to work with Facebook on these topics and despite the fact we are competing. We have a long history at Viber of taking very clear positions around these topics. When the US administration decided to impose travel bans for seven weeks on a list of countries, we immediately decided to make all calls from the US to those countries —and vice versa— free, because there were people stuck in airports who couldn't get in or get out and couldn't reach their families. This is just one example among many that show Viber's values are not tactical moves that we make upon considering the situation. For the last ten years, we have shown our attachment to those values, our attachment to diversity, our attachment to privacy and security of the chats on Viber, and this is not related to competition.
 

 
We respect the legislation, the rules & laws of all the countries we operate in. We, of course, comply with all those regulations, because we are a public company and this is what we have to do. One thing that needs to be clear is the fact that every exchange on Viber platforms are private exchanges -- chats and calls are protected by end to end encryption, which means that not even Viber staff can access the contents of a chat or call. So when we are required by authorities in the framework of legal operations, such as a subpoena from a legal court of justice, we deliver information we can deliver within the limits of our architecture -- the content of chats are not something we have access to. Respecting the rules and laws of the countries where you operate is obviously something that we have to do -- there are a couple of countries in the world where the rule of law does not allow Viber to operate, and we have decided not to operate in those countries.
It's a very important question and a very difficult one to answer. There is one aspect which is very important – the difference between private discussion and public discussions. At Viber, we consider private discussions are purely private and they must be secured, safe and respected. They cannot be accessed by anyone, they cannot be analysed for any purpose, not even commercial purposes.
When we talk about public discussions, in Viber we have some communities that are unlimited groups (with) an unlimited number of participants, which are done for public speeches/public discussions between people and communities of people or celebrities, politicians, brands etc. In those kinds of context, we consider any violent rhetoric, aggressive rhetoric, terrorist rhetoric or anything that could be targeting adults and are not appropriate for children in general, cannot stay on Viber. So we invest a lot of money and resources to analyse these content automatically, through artificial intelligence, and manually, through human beings, to check the content and either flag it or ban it. In some cases, we had to ban entire communities of people because they were not respecting our policies. It is a never-ending effort that we need to do because it's our role. We think we are part of a society where we also have a role to protect the people that are using our platforms.  
 We really think that Viber must be seen and perceived as a second home. And when you think about your home, it's a place where you speak the language, where you like the colours, where you find people that you know and content that you like. We work hard to make sure that some countries — important ones, and Bangladesh is one of them— have access to features where users are able to localise, customise, personalise the Viber experience to the culture, to the country, to the colours of the country to the content expected for the country. This is why we have decided to add a new language option last year for Bangladesh.
We will do more by adding local content providers, for instance, news providers are coming soon. We are working on a payment solution with a local partner to send money to each other. In the future in Bangladesh, just like in other countries, we will provide for brands and some local services the ability to create and deliver services within Viber. We are looking at chatbots so that banks and telecom services or insurance or an E-commerce company can provide their services through Viber.

A mint-green hardback covered book-spine caught my eye;A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett. ","During the long lockdown in early 2020, I took stock of my shelvedunread books. A mint-green hardback covered book-spine caught my eye;A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett. Almost always, I know the provenance of my books. Who? Where? When? Whom? Was it bought or gifted? Full-price or bargain-buy? On this book I drew a blank. In 2019, my sister had handed it over saying it belonged to me. It must have emerged from some carton of books that had travelled the globe with the family; got lost, then found by me during the 2020 pandemic.
On 29th May 2020, I opened the book and read the following inscription:
To Raana Ahmad
Pappa
Paris 17.5.'57
A clear blue and white sticker states:
W.H. Smith & Son
English & French Books
248 Rue de Rivoli PARIS
I do not recall ever having read this book. Sixty-three years after being gifted this book by my father on my birthday on 17th May, I started reading Little Princess in May 2020. In hand was not a treasure found in the attic but its equivalent. Enhanced by the patina of age, I was reuniting with a precious item of immense personal value and considerable historical context.
W.H. Smith & Son, ""the largest English bookshop in Paris"" in the""City of Light"" opened its doors on the elegant Rue de Rivoli in 1903. It was a regular source of children's books for us living in Paris in the mid-1950s. Birthdays and good report card results merited books as gifts in those days. Purchases were sugared by a climb to the upstairs English Tearoom which offered a full traditional tea service: egg and cucumber finger sandwiches, scones with clotted cream and marmalade; also fruit and chocolate cakes. Those childhood taste-bud memories remain fixed in one's mind and tongue. Over following decades, WH Smith (""Son"" dropped out) continued being a lure for a ""peeping person"" to browse books and more often than not a visit upstairs.
Hemingway's A Moveable Feastis my current re-read for its heartfelt passages of devotion to Paris; including the unforgettable lines Hadley, Hemingway's wife marks: ""There are so many sorts of hunger...Memory is hunger.""My copy was bought on 12.09.97 notes the WHSmith sticker.I was once again living in Paris in the late 1990s. Mentioning to the salesperson my childhood association with this historical store brimming with beckoning books, I was presented with a ""Carte de Fidelite"" granting me 5% discount on purchases. My cup of wistful nostalgia was complete. I was told that many global customers return with such stories, now accompanied by their children and grandchildren. I had my daughter in tow.Only I was told that the English Tearoom had shut down sometime in the 1980s. Disappointment set in. The tea treat was part of the past and much anticipated present; a rediscovery through random stimulations in the present. To my utter delight, while researching this write-up, I took note that in 2016 the British Tearoom on the first floor had reopened, sponsored by Twinings of London. My ""bucket list"" in post-pandemic travel includes literary retail therapy downstairs and then culinary indulgence upstairs; while taking in the food with a view over the Tuileries gardens, the front facing landscape of the Louvre Museum.
Following reading A Little Princess and its personal Parisian association, I read My Life in France (1961) by Julia Child, the autobiography by the American celebrity chef whose books and television presentations on French cuisine became trademarks of her culinary expertise. I had bought this book few years back at W.H. Smith on Rue de Rivoli. With considerable amusement, I read of Julia's exasperation: ""I've had it! I'm going to learn to speak this language, come hell or high water!...I signed up for a class at Berlitz...Paul, (husband and fluent in French) made up sentences to help my pronunciation: for the rolling French ""r"" s and extended ""u"" s, he had me repeat the phrase ""Le serrurier sur la Rue de Rivoli"" ('""he locksmith on the Rue de Rivoli"") over and over."" Julia Child evolved into the consummate Francophile. An American cinema adaptation Julia and Jule was made in 2009 with Meryl Streep cast as the ebullient and efficient Julia Child.
Frances Hodgson Burnett (1849-1924) was a British-born novelist and playwright who moved to United States as a teenager. She gained lasting success writing for children: Little Lord Fauntleroy (1885), A Little Princess (1905) and Secret Garden (1911). Although she had never been to India, the last two novels have Indian links and characters in the narrative. Once I Googled the author, I was taken aback to learn that A Little Princess was first adapted to screen as a silent film in 1917. The Hollywood child sweetheart Shirley Temple played Sarah Crewe in the 1939 ""talkie"" cinematic version of A Little Princess.  In the 1970s, it was screened by the BBC as a mini-series; as well as a British-American production in the 1980s. The 1990s saw an American adaptation, a Filipino productionas well as a Russian book-to-screen adaptation of this ever-green children's book. A Little Princess endured sufficient appeal for a Japanese drama television series in 2009. To my utter amazement, it is available on YouTube from 5th March 2020. Her literary classics have been on offer for over a century - from silent film screening to YouTube.
Sara Crewe""Little Missus,"" a seven-year old English girl accompanied by her doting father arrives in London at ""Miss Minchin, Select Seminary for Young Ladies.""""Big Missus"" had died in British India at Sara's birth.The duo had sailed from Bombay to this place.Since""the climate of India was very bad for children, and as soon as possible they were sent away from it - generally to England and to school...She was to have a pretty bedroom and sitting room of her own; she was to have a pony and a carriage, and a maid to take the place of the ayah who had been her nurse in India.""  Miss Minchin sensing financial credentials in the Crewes' dress and demeanour; upfront pampers but underneath resents Sara. ""Sara had always been an annoying puzzle to her, because severity never made her cry or look frightened. making no complaint or outward sign of rebellion.""An introspective child, she becomes ""Mama"" to lonely motherless four year old Lottie. Sara befriends Ermengarde St. John, ""... she took fancy to fat, slow, little Miss St. John."" Sara's otherfriend Becky is the over-worked scullery maid, a fourteen-year old girl ""but so stunted in growth."" Sara's closest friend and confidante is her doll Emily. Mature and resilient beyond her tender years, Sara seeks to maintain composure to combat lonely turmoil, rigid regulations and hostile surroundings.Escapism is her inner narrative in adversity; retreating to a make-believe world; leaving this world to live in another sphere where in her father's eyes she remains ""A Little Princess.""
The turning point in Sara's life comes when her father goes bankrupt in a diamond mine scam in India and dies of ""jungle fever."" She is now eleven years old. Her new status is revealed to her by Miss Minchin: ""I tell you that you are quite alone in the world...unless I choose to keep you here out of charity."" A bare, cold attic becomes Sara's room. No longer a student, she is now a servant. When Sara becomes ""One of the Populace"" as the chapter is titled; despite her physical and emotional upheaval, a survival mentality prods her: ""Her way of doing it was to ""pretend"" and ""suppose"" with all the strength that was left in her... And once or twice she thought it almost made her more cold and hungry instead of less so.""
An attic window opening introduces her to her neighbour, an Indian turbaned ""lascar"" Ram Das who lives in the attic room ""The Other Side of the Wall.""  He is appalled at the child's misery.""The Magic"" is instigated by Das and his English Saheb. Warm bedding, food, firewood and flowers appear in her room. Lo and behold, the narrative takes an even happier turn when Ram's employer is none other than her father's dear English friend from India who had also invested in the diamond mine. Only, there was no bankruptcy and Mr. Carrisford had been on the search for Sara who is the inheritor of a large fortune. Her imaginary role of ""A Little Princess"" becomes reality. ""Once upon a time"" could easily have been prefixed at the start of the story. And true to any fairy tale; Sara lives""happily ever after"" as ""A Little Princess."" Any eight-year old would have been happy with its reading.
A unique literary experience has been measured some six decades later. The association between the book and its reader is enduring and textured; meaningfully layered with insight into human qualities, foibles and frailties. In these insecure times, do we not fall into moments of angst and despair? In the most unpromising of situations, there still lies the unexpectedness of the power of kindness, the offering of warmth and wisdom. In times of turmoil, internal and external; does not reading of choice offer a causeway to reflection, a hopeful window of escape? Here is a short read but replete with reflective thoughts and lasting takeaways. In the words of Zadie Smith, ""Happiness is not an absolute value. It is a state of comparison.""
Was A Little Princess a popular children's book recommended by the sales staff at W.H. Smith & Son? Was the Indian element influential in its selection? Did my father see it on display in the shop window? A biibliophile, had he read an article about the book and thought it would be an appropriate gift? Or did the book title simply appeal to him? I will never know. Pappa passed away in 1986.
